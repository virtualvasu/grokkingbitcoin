This chapter covers

* Understanding Bitcoin’s problems

* Moving signatures out of transactions

Bitcoin is far from perfect. It has several shortcomings that we
should address. The first section of this chapter will explain some of
these shortcomings. Among the most critical are _transaction
malleability_ and inefficiencies in signature verification. We’ve
already mentioned transaction malleability in
<<time-locked-transactions>>—someone might change a transaction in
subtle, but valid, ways while it’s being broadcast, which will cause
its txid to change.

A solution to these problems was presented at a 2015 conference on
Bitcoin scaling. This solution is known as _segregated witness_
(segwit), which is a weird name for moving signature data out of
transactions. I’ll describe this solution in detail: it includes
changes in pretty much all parts of Bitcoin, including Bitcoin
addresses, transaction format, block format, local storage, and
network protocol.

Because segwit was a pretty big change in Bitcoin, it wasn’t trivial
to deploy without disrupting the network. It was carefully designed so
old software would continue working and accepting segwit transactions
and blocks, although without verifying certain parts of them.

=== Problems solved by segwit

In this section, we’ll discuss the problems that segwit will solve.

==== Transaction malleability

To explain transaction malleability, let’s go back to the example in
<<ch09>> in which you gave a time-locked transaction to your daughter.
When almost a year has passed since you created your time-locked
transaction, you need to invalidate that transaction and create a new
time-locked transaction, as <<fig1001>> shows.

[[fig1001]]
.You spend one of the outputs that the previous time-locked transaction spends and create a new time-locked transaction that you give to your daughter.
image::{imagedir}/10-01.svg[{full-width}]

It’s important to give the new time-locked transaction, Tx~3~, to your
daughter before broadcasting Tx~2~, which invalidates the previous
time-locked transaction, Tx~1~. Otherwise, if you do it the other way
around and get hit by a bus between the two steps, your daughter won’t
be able to claim the money.

Suppose you do this correctly and first give Tx~3~ to your daughter and
then broadcast Tx~2~. Tx~3~ spends the output of Tx~2~, which means
Tx~3~ contains the txid of Tx~2~ in one of its inputs. Let’s see what
might happen when you broadcast Tx~2~ (<<fig1002>>).

[[fig1002]]
.Your transaction is being modified by Qi on its way through the network.
image::{imagedir}/10-02.svg[{big-width}]

[.gbinfo]
.Malleability
****
The word _malleate_ means to form—for example, metal with a
hammer. This term is used in cryptography to mean changing a signature
without making it invalid or changing an encrypted message without
making it totally garbled.
****

Qi wants to mess things up. When she receives your transaction Tx~2~,
she modifies it in a certain way into Tx~2M~, so Tx~2M~ is still
valid and has the same effect as the original transaction, Tx~2~.
(You’ll see shortly some different ways she can do this.) The result is
that two different transactions now flow through the network that spend
the same outputs and send the money to the same recipients with the same
amounts—but they have _different txids_.

Because Tx~2~ and Tx~2M~ spend the same outputs, they’re in conflict
with each other, and at most one of them will be confirmed. Suppose
Tx~2M~ is the winner and gets mined in the next block. What happens to
your daughter’s inheritance? See <<fig1003>>.

[[fig1003]]
.The inheritance fails because your daughter’s time-locked transaction is forever invalid due to transaction malleability.
image::{imagedir}/10-03.svg[{big-width}]

The _malleated_ transaction, Tx~2M~, is stored in the blockchain. This
makes Tx~2~ invalid because it spends the same output as Tx~2M~. The
first input of the time-locked transaction, Tx~3~, references Tx~2~
using its txid, so when 30 April 2020 has passed, your daughter won’t be
able to claim her inheritance: she’ll be trying to spend an output from
an invalid transaction.

===== How can Qi change the txid?

Qi has several options for changing the transaction without invalidating
it. They all involve changing the signature script in one way or
another. <<fig1004>> shows three classes of transaction malleability.

[[fig1004]]
.Three classes of transaction malleability
image::{imagedir}/10-04.svg[{full-width}]

[.inbitcoin]
.BIP66
****
BIP66 fixes the first class of malleability issues.
****

The first one modifies the signature container format, which changes how
the signature is _encoded_ in the signature script. You can encode the
signature in a few different ways that are all valid. This issue was
fixed in a system upgrade by using BIP66, which requires all signatures
to be encoded in a specific way. The fix was activated in block 363724.

The second way to malleate a transaction is to use cryptographic tricks.
I won’t go into details here, but the signature, regardless of the
container format, can be modified in a few ways that don’t make it
invalid. Only one such trick is known, but we can’t rule out that there
are others.

The last approach is about changing the script program itself. You can
do this in several ways. The one in <<fig1004>> first duplicates
(`OP_DUP`) the top item on the stack and then immediately removes
(`OP_DROP`) the duplicate from the stack; effectively, this change does
nothing, and the whole program will run just fine.

The second and third forms of transaction malleability are somewhat
limited by _relay policies_. This means nodes will require that the
signatures conform to specific rules and that no script operators except
data pushes be present in the signature script. Otherwise, the node
won’t relay the transaction. But nothing is stopping a miner from mining
malleated transactions. Relay policies are implemented to make
transaction malleability harder, but they can’t prevent it.

[[inefficient-sighash]]
==== Inefficient signature verification

When a transaction is signed, the signature algorithm hashes the
transaction in a certain way.

Remember from <<sign-transaction>> that you clean all signature
scripts before signing. But if you did _just_ that, all the
transaction’s signatures would use the exact same hash. If the
transaction spent two different outputs that pay to the same address,
the signature in one of the inputs could be reused in the other input.
That property could be exploited by bad actors.

[.gbinfo]
.Why not use a dummy byte?
****
Inserting the pubkey script into the signature script seems
unnecessary.  It’d be simpler to add a single dummy byte in the
signature script to avoid signature reuse. No one really knows why the
pubkey script is used for this.
****

To avoid this problem, Bitcoin makes each signature commit to a slightly
different version of the transaction by copying the spent pubkey script
into the signature script of the input that’s currently being signed.

Let’s zoom in a bit on what’s happening. Suppose you want to sign a
transaction with two inputs. The first input is signed as illustrated in
<<fig1005>>.

[[fig1005]]
.Signing the first input. You prepare by copying the pubkey script to the signature script.
image::{imagedir}/10-05.svg[{big-width}]

The signature scripts of all inputs are empty, but you copy the pubkey
script of the spent output and insert it into the signature script of
the spending input. You then create the signature for the first input
and move on to sign the second input (<<fig1006>>).

[[fig1006]]
.Signing the second input
image::{imagedir}/10-06.svg[{big-width}]

Here, all signature scripts except the second one are empty. The second
signature script is populated with the spent output’s pubkey script. The
signature is then created.

By doing this exercise for each input, you ensure that signatures aren’t
reusable across inputs if signed by the same private key. But this also
introduces a problem: signature verification becomes inefficient.

Suppose you want to verify the signatures of the aforementioned
transaction. For every input, you need to perform basically the same
procedure as when the transaction was signed: clean all the signature
scripts from the transaction and then, one at a time, insert the pubkey
script in the signature script of the input you want to verify. Then,
verify the signature for that input.

This might seem harmless, but as the number of inputs grows, the amount
of data to hash for each signature increases. If you double the number
of inputs, you roughly

* Double the number of signatures to verify

* Double the size of the transaction

[.gbinfo]
.Why 1 ms?
****
The 1 ms time is just an example. The actual time to verify a
transaction varies among nodes.
****

If the time to verify the transaction with two inputs in <<fig1007>>
is 1 ms, it will take 4 ms to verify a transaction with four
inputs. Double the number of inputs again, and you have 16 ms. A
transaction with 1,024 inputs would take more than 4 minutes!

[[fig1007]]
.Total time for hashing during signature verification. Time roughly quadruples when the number of inputs doubles.
image::{imagedir}/10-07.svg[{full-width}]

This weakness can be exploited by creating a large transaction with a
lot of inputs. All nodes verifying the transaction will be occupied for
minutes, making them unable to verify other transactions and blocks
during this time. The Bitcoin network as a whole would slow down.

It would be much better if the transaction verification time grew
linearly instead of quadratically: the time to verify a transaction
would double as the number of inputs doubled. Then, the 1,024 inputs
would take roughly 512 ms to verify instead of 4 minutes.

==== Waste of bandwidth

When a full node sends a transaction to a lightweight wallet, it sends
the complete transaction, which includes all signature data. But a
lightweight wallet can’t verify the signatures because it doesn’t have
the spent outputs.

The signature scripts constitute a large percentage of the transaction
size. A typical signature script spending a p2pkh output takes 107
bytes. Consider a few different transactions with two outputs, as
<<tab1001>> shows.

[[tab1001]]
.Space occupied by signature script data of different typical transactions
|===
| Inputs | Total signature script size (bytes) | Tx size (bytes) | Signature script percentage

| 1 | 107 | 224 | 47%
| 2 | 214 | 373 | 57%
| 3 | 321 | 521 | 61%
| 8 | 856 | 1255 | 68%
|===

[.bigside]
****
image::{imagedir}/u10-01.svg[]
****

Wouldn’t it be nice if a full node didn’t have to send the signature
script data to the lightweight wallet? You’d probably save more than
50% data traffic. There’s just one problem: such data is needed to
calculate txids. If you skip sending signature scripts of
transactions, the lightweight wallet won’t be able to verify that the
transaction is included in a block because it can’t verify the merkle
proof (<<fig1008>>).

[[fig1008]]
.Without the signature scripts, a lightweight wallet can’t verify that a transaction is included in the block.
image::{imagedir}/10-08.svg[{big-width}]

We’d definitely like to solve this somehow.

==== Script upgrades are hard

Sometimes, we want to extend the script language with new operations.
For example, `OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY` (`OP_CSV`) and
`OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY` (`OP_CLTV`) were introduced in the language in
2015 and 2016. Let’s look at how `OP_CLTV` was introduced.

We’ll start with what `OP_` codes are. They’re nothing but a single
byte. `OP_EQUAL` for example, is represented by the byte `87` in hex
code. Every node knows that when it encounters byte `87` in the script
program, it needs to compare the top two items on the stack and push the
result back on the stack. `OP_CHECKMULTISIG` is also a single byte,
`ae`. All operators are represented by different bytes.

When Bitcoin was created, several NOP operators, `OP_NOP1`–`OP_NOP10`,
were specified. These are represented by the bytes `b0`–`b9`. They’re
designed to do nothing. The name NOP comes from No OPeration, which
basically means, “When this instruction appears, ignore it and move on.”

These NOPs can be used to extend the script language, but only to a
certain extent. The `OP_CLTV` operator is actually `OP_NOP2`, or byte
`b1`. `OP_CLTV` was introduced by releasing a version of Bitcoin Core
that redefines how `OP_NOP2` works. But it needs to be done in a
compatible way so we don’t break compatibility with old, non-upgraded
nodes.

Let’s go back to the example from <<absolute-time-locked-outputs>>,
where you gave your daughter an allowance in advance that she could
cash out on 1 May (see <<fig1009>>).

[[fig1009]]
.Using `OP_CLTV` to lock an output until 1 May
image::{imagedir}/10-09.svg[{half-width}]

The pubkey script for this output is

[subs="normal"]
----
<may 1 2019 00:00:00> OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY OP_DROP
OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <PKH~D~> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
----

This is how a new node—which is aware of the new meaning of byte
`b1`—interprets the script. It will do the following:

. Push the time `<1 may 2019 00:00:00>` to the stack.

. Check that the spending transaction’s lock time has at least the value
found on top of the stack, or fail immediately otherwise.

. Drop the time value from the stack.

. Continue with normal signature verification.

An old node, on the other hand, will interpret the script as follows:

[subs="normal"]
----
<may 1 2019 00:00:00> OP_NOP2 OP_DROP
OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <PKH~D~> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
----

It will

. Push the time `<1 may 2019 00:00:00>` to the stack.

. _Do nothing._

. Drop the time value from the stack.

. Continue with normal signature verification.

Old nodes still treat `OP_NOP2` as they used to—by doing nothing and
moving on. They aren’t aware of the new rules associated with the byte
`b1`.

The old and the new nodes will behave the same if the `OP_CLTV` succeeds
on the new node. But if the `OP_CLTV` fails on the new node, the old
node won’t fail, because “do nothing” never fails. The new nodes fail
more often than the old nodes because new nodes have stricter rules. The
old nodes will always finish the script program with success whenever
the new nodes finish with success. This is known as a _soft fork_—a
system upgrade that doesn’t require all nodes to upgrade. We’ll talk
more about forks, system upgrades, and alternate currencies born from
Bitcoin’s blockchain in <<ch11>>.

You might be wondering what the `OP_DROP` instruction is for. `OP_DROP`
takes the top item on the stack and discards it. `OP_CLTV` is designed
to behave exactly like `OP_NOP2` when it succeeds. If `OP_CLTV` had been
designed without taking old nodes into account, it would probably remove
the top item from the stack. But because we need to take old nodes into
account, `OP_CLTV` doesn’t do that. We must add the extra `OP_DROP`
after `OP_CLTV` to get rid of the time item from the stack.

This was an example of how old script operators can be repurposed to do
something stricter without disrupting the entire network.

This method of script upgrades has been done for two operators so far:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Byte | Old code | New code | New meaning

| `b1` | `OP_NOP2` | `OP_CLTV` | Verify that the spending transaction
has a high enough absolute lock time.
| `b2` | `OP_NOP3` | `OP_CSV` | Verify that the spending input has a
  high enough relative lock time.
|===

Only 10 `OP_NOP` operators are available to use for script upgrades, and
such upgrades are limited to exactly mimic the `OP_NOP` behavior if they
don’t fail.

Sooner or later, we’ll need another script-upgrade mechanism, both
because we’ll run out of ``OP_NOP``s and because we want the new script
operators to behave differently than `OP_NOP` when they succeed.

=== Solutions

A solution to all these problems was presented at a 2015
conference. The solution was to move the signature scripts out of
transactions altogether.

Let’s look again at the anatomy of a normal transaction, shown in
<<fig1010>>.

[[fig1010]]
.The txid is calculated from the entire transaction, including signature scripts.
image::{imagedir}/10-10.svg[{big-width}]

If we could change the system so the txid didn’t cover the signature
script, we’d remove all known possibilities of unintentional transaction
malleability. Unfortunately, if we did this, we’d make old software
incompatible because it calculates the txid in the traditional way.

[.inbitcoin]
.BIP141
****
The new rules defined by segregated witness are specified in BIP141,
“Segregated Witness (Consensus layer).”
****

Segwit solves this problem and all the aforementioned problems in a
forward- and backward-compatible way:

* Forward-compatible because blocks created by new software work with old
software

* Backward-compatible because blocks created by old software work with new
software

In crypto-lingo, a _witness_ basically means a signature. It’s something
that attests to the authenticity of something. For a Bitcoin
transaction, the witness is the contents of the signature scripts,
because that’s what proves the transaction is authenticated.
_Segregated_ means parted, so we part the contents of the signature
scripts from the transaction, effectively leaving the signature scripts
empty, as <<fig1011>> shows.

[[fig1011]]
.A segwit transaction contains no signature data. The signatures are attached, instead. The txid doesn’t commit to the signatures.
image::{imagedir}/10-11.svg[{big-width}]

[role="important"]

_Segregated witness_ thus means the contents of the signature scripts
are removed from the transaction and put into an external structure
called the witness.

We’ll follow a few segwit transactions to see how they affect the
different parts of the Bitcoin system. But first, let’s get some bitcoin
into a segwit wallet.

==== Segwit addresses

Suppose your wallet uses segwit, and you’re selling a laptop to Amy.
Your wallet needs to create an address that you can give to Amy. So far,
nothing new.

[.inbitcoin]
.BIP173
****
This BIP defines the checksummed encoding scheme Bech32 and how segwit
addresses are composed and encoded using Bech32.
****

But segwit defines a new address type that’s encoded using _Bech32_
instead of base58check. Suppose your wallet creates the following
segwit address:

 bc1qeqzjk7vume5wmrdgz5xyehh54cchdjag6jdmkj

This address format provides several improvements compared to the
base58check addresses you’re used to:

* All characters are of the same case, which means

** QR codes can be made smaller.

** Addresses are easier to verbally read out.

* The checksum used in Bech32 will detect up to four character errors
with 100% certainty. If there are more character errors, the
probability of detection failure is less than one in a billion. This
is a major improvement to the 4-byte checksum in base58check, which
doesn’t provide any guarantee.

Your segwit address consists of two parts. The first two characters,
`bc` (short for bitcoin) is the _human-readable part_. The `1` is a
delimiter between the human-readable part and the _data part_, which
encodes the actual information that Amy will use to create the
transaction output:

* A version, 0 in this case.

* A _witness program_. In this case, the witness program is a PKH,
`c8052b79…3176cba8`.

We’ll explain what the witness program is a bit further on. Think about
it as a PKH for now. The version and witness program aren’t directly
extractable from the address because they’re encoded using bech32. You
give the address `bc1qeqzj…ag6jdmkj` to Amy by showing her a QR code.
She has a modern wallet that understands this address format, so she
scans your address and extracts the version and witness program, as
<<fig1012>> illustrates.

[[fig1012]]
.Amy decodes the segwit address to get the witness version and the witness program.
image::{imagedir}/10-12.svg[{full-width}]

[.inbitcoin]
.Checksum
****
I won’t go into details on the checksum. I encourage the interested
reader to read BIP173.
****

This occurs in multiple steps:

1. The human-readable part and the data part are separated.

2. The data part of the address is converted, character by character,
into numbers using a base32 lookup table. The first of these numbers
is the witness version, `0`. The following numbers, except the last
six, are the witness program. The last six numbers are the checksum.

3. The checksum is verified; no errors were detected in this example.

4. The witness program is rewritten by writing each number as a 5-bit
number.

5. The bits are rearranged in groups of 8 bits. Each such group
represents a byte of the witness program.

6. Amy extracts the witness program as `c8052b7…3176cba8`.

Amy creates a transaction with a new kind of pubkey script that you
aren’t used to (<<fig1013>>).

[[fig1013]]
.Amy sends 0.1 BTC to your segwit address. The pubkey script doesn’t contain any script operators, just data.
image::{imagedir}/10-13.svg[{big-width}]

She broadcasts this transaction on the Bitcoin network. The network
will accept the transaction because it’s correctly signed in the
old-fashioned way. Eventually, it will be confirmed in a block. Your
wallet will acknowledge that you’ve received the money, and you’ll
give the laptop to Amy.

==== Spending your segwit output

Now that you’ve received your money, you want to spend it on a used
popcorn machine. It costs only 0.09 BTC. It’s a bargain! Suppose the
owner of the popcorn machine has the segwit address `bc1qlk34…ul0qwrqp`.

Your transaction sends the money to the popcorn machine owner’s segwit
address and pays a 0.01 BTC transaction fee (<<fig1014>>). The input
has an empty signature script; the signature data is instead added as
a _witness field_ in the attached witness.

[[fig1014]]
.You create and broadcast a payment to the popcorn machine owner.
image::{imagedir}/10-14.svg[{big-width}]

Had there been multiple inputs in this transaction, there would be
multiple witness fields in the witness, one for each input. You can mix
segwit inputs and legacy inputs, in which case the witness fields for
the legacy inputs would be empty because their signatures are in the
respective signature script, as they always were.

==== Verifying the segwit transaction

You’ve sent your transaction for the popcorn machine to the Bitcoin
peer-to-peer network for processing. Let’s see how an upgraded full
node verifies this transaction before relaying it to other nodes
(<<fig1015>>). Because it’s running the latest and greatest software,
it knows how to deal with segwit transactions.

[[fig1015]]
.A full node verifies your transaction’s witness. The pattern `00` followed by exactly 20 bytes gets special treatment.
image::{imagedir}/10-15.svg[{full-width}]

[.gbinfo]
.Remember p2sh
****
A segwit output is recognized by pattern matching, just like a p2sh
output was in <<ch05>>.
****

The full node, which knows about segwit, looks for a pattern in the
pubkey script starting with a single version byte followed by a 2- to
40-byte witness program. In this case, the pattern matches, which
means this is a segwit output.

The next step for the full node is to understand what _kind_ of segwit
output it is. As of this writing, there’s only one version of segwit
output: version `00`. This version comes in two different flavors:

* _Pay-to-witness-public-key-hash (p2wpkh)_, identified by a 20-byte
witness program, as in this example

* _Pay-to-witness-script-hash (p2wsh)_, identified by a 32-byte witness
program. p2wsh will be explained later in this chapter.

[.gbinfo]
.Why “witness program”?
****
It’s called a witness program because it can be regarded as a program
of a weird language. In version `00`, the witness program is a single
operator whose length defines its behavior.
****

In this case, we have the version byte `00` followed by exactly 20 bytes,
which means this is a p2wpkh payment. If the version byte is unknown to
the node, the node will immediately accept this input without further
processing. This acceptance of unknown versions will become useful for
future, forward-compatible upgrades of the script language. All segwit
nodes will recognize version `00`.

The p2wpkh is the simplest of the two types because it’s similar to the
well-known p2pkh. Let’s look at how they both work:

* _p2pkh_—The pubkey script contains the actual script that checks the
signature in the signature script.

* _p2wpkh_—The actual script is a predetermined template, and the
witness program _is_ the PKH to insert into the script template. The
signature and the public key are taken from the witness.

In the end, it’s seemingly the exact same program that is run for both
of these two types. The difference is where the components come from.
But other differences exist between segwit scripts and legacy
scripts—for example, the meaning of `OP_CHECKSIG` has changed, as you’ll
see in <<new-hashing-algorithm>>.

Why do p2wpkh at all when we’re running the exact same script program as
in p2pkh? Recall that we want to solve transaction malleability. We do
this by removing the signature data from the transaction inputs so no
one can change the txid by making subtle changes to the signature
script.

The full node has verified this transaction and sends it to its peers.
There’s just one problem: one peer has no idea what segwit is. It’s an
old node that hasn’t been upgraded for a while.

===== “Verifying” on old nodes

An old node has just received your transaction and wants to verify it.
Old nodes know nothing about segwit or that there are witnesses attached
to transactions. The old node downloads the transaction as it always
has, which is without the witness attachment. <<fig1016>> shows what
the node sees.

[[fig1016]]
.An old node sees just two data items in the pubkey script and an empty signature script.
image::{imagedir}/10-16.svg[{big-width}]

Because the node doesn’t know anything else, it creates the script
program by taking the empty signature script and appending the pubkey
script. The resulting program looks like this:

 00 c8052b799cde68ed8da8150c4cdef4ae3176cba8

The node runs this program. The program puts two data items on the
stack—first `00`, and then the `c805…cba8`. When it’s done, there’s
nothing left to do but check whether the top item on the stack,
`c805…cba8`, is `true`. Bitcoin defines anything that’s nonzero to be
true, so this script will pass, and the transaction is authorized.

This doesn’t seem very secure. This is known as an _anyone-can-spend_,
meaning anyone can create a transaction that spends the output. It
requires no signature. You just have to create an input with an empty
signature script to take the money.

[.inbitcoin]
.Nonstandard transactions
****
A node that doesn't recognize the spent script type normally doesn't
relay the transaction. It's considered nonstandard. This relay policy
reduces the risk that a transaction that uses the segwit output as an
anyone-can-spend ends up in a block.
****

In <<ch11>>, we’ll talk about how to deploy upgrades like segwit
safely. For now, you can assume that 95% of the hashrate (miners) run
with segwit. If a transaction uses your output as an anyone-can-spend,
and a non-segwit miner includes it in a block, then this block will be
rejected by 95% of the hashrate and consequently excluded from the
strongest chain. The miner will lose its block reward.

==== Including your segwit transaction in a block

Your segwit transaction has propagated through the network, and all
nodes have verified it along the way. Now, a miner wants to insert the
transaction into a new block. Suppose the miner runs modern software and
thus knows about segwit. Let’s look at how it’s included in the block
(<<fig1017>>).

[[fig1017]]
.Your segwit transaction gets included in a block. The block commits to the witnesses by putting the witness commitment into an output of the coinbase transaction.
image::{imagedir}/10-17.svg[{full-width}]

The block is built as before, but with one important difference. A new
block rule is introduced in segwit: if there are segwit transactions in
the block, the coinbase transaction must contain an output with a
_witness commitment_. This witness commitment is the combined hash of
the _witness root hash_ and a _witness reserved value_. The witness
root hash is the merkle root of the _witness txids_ (_wtxids_) of all
transactions in the block. The wtxid is the hash of the transaction
_including the witness_, if there is one. An exception exists for the
coinbase, whose wtxid is always defined as 32 zero bytes. The witness
reserved value is dedicated for future system upgrades.

The witness commitment is written in an `OP_RETURN` output (<<fig1018>>).

[[fig1018]]
.The coinbase transaction’s witness contains the witness reserved value, and an `OP_RETURN` output contains the witness commitment.
image::{imagedir}/10-18.svg[{big-width}]

The witness reserved value can be any value. But a full node verifying
this block needs a way to know what that value is. If the node didn’t
know the witness reserved value, it wouldn’t be able to reconstruct the
witness commitment for comparison with the `OP_RETURN` output’s witness
commitment. The coinbase transaction’s witness contains the witness
reserved value so full nodes can verify the witness commitment.

===== Old nodes verifying the block

The block in <<fig1017>> is valid for new segwit-enabled full nodes, so
it must also be valid for old nodes that don’t know what segwit is. An
old node won’t download any witnesses from its peers because it doesn’t
know they exist (<<fig1019>>).

[[fig1019]]
.An old node verifies the block with your transaction. It won’t verify the signatures or the witness commitment.
image::{imagedir}/10-19.svg[{big-width}]

This node will do what it’s always done—run the scripts of the
transactions, which will look like spending anyone-can-spend outputs.
That’s OK, move on. If some of the transactions in the block are
non-segwit, those transactions will be fully verified.

We’ve now gone full circle with your transaction to the popcorn machine
owner, who hands over the machine to you.

==== Pay-to-witness-script-hash

Do you remember when we introduced p2sh in <<pay-to-script-hash>>?
p2sh moves the pubkey script part of the program to the spending
input. Let’s have another look at the charity wallet that John, Ellen,
and Faiza set up (<<fig1020>>).

[[fig1020]]
.John and Faiza spend an output from their multisig wallet.
image::{imagedir}/10-20.svg[{big-width}]

The idea here was that the payer—the donor, in this case—shouldn’t have
to pay a higher fee for a big, complex pubkey script. Instead, the
recipient wanting to use this fancy scheme will pay for the complexity.

With segwit, you can do about the same thing using
pay-to-witness-script-hash, which is the segwit version of p2sh. Isn’t
naming in Bitcoin fantastic?

Suppose John, Ellen, and Faiza use segwit for their charity wallet and
that the previous popcorn machine owner wants to give the money he
received for the popcorn machine to the charity.

John, Ellen, and Faiza must provide the popcorn guy with a p2wsh
address. Their _witness script_ is the same as their p2sh _redeem
script_ was when they were using p2sh (<<fig1021>>).

[[fig1021]]
.The witness script is hashed into a witness script hash.
image::{imagedir}/10-21.svg[{half-width}]

They use this witness script hash to create a p2wsh address in the same
way you created your p2wpkh address. They encode

 00 983b977f86b9bce124692e68904935f5e562c88226befb8575b4a51e29db9062

using Bech32 and get the p2wsh address:

 bc1qnqaewluxhx7wzfrf9e5fqjf47hjk9jyzy6l0hpt4kjj3u2wmjp3qr3lft8

This address is handed to the popcorn guy, who creates and broadcasts a
transaction like that shown in <<fig1022>>.

[[fig1022]]
.The popcorn guy sends the money to the charity’s p2wsh address.
image::{imagedir}/10-22.svg[{full-width}]

The transaction has the witness attached, just like your transaction to
the popcorn guy. The only difference between your transaction and the
popcorn guy’s transaction is that their outputs have a different witness
program length. Your transaction had a 20-byte witness program because
it was a SHA256+RIPEMD160 hash of a public key, and the popcorn guy’s
transaction has a 32-byte witness program because that’s a SHA256
of a witness script.

This transaction will be verified and eventually included in a block.

===== Spending the p2wsh transaction

Suppose John and Faiza want to spend the 0.08 BTC they got from the
popcorn guy by sending it to a shelter for homeless people. The shelter
happens to also have a p2wsh address. John and Faiza collaborate to
create the transaction <<fig1023>> shows.

[[fig1023]]
.The charity pays 0.07 BTC to the shelter’s address. The witness is the signatures followed by a data item that contains the actual witness script.
image::{imagedir}/10-23.svg[{full-width}]

Note how there’s nothing in the signature script. When we used p2sh in
<<pay-to-script-hash>>, the signature script got really big because it
contained two signatures and the redeem script, which in turn
contained three public keys. With segwit, all data is contained in the
witness instead.

===== Verifying the p2wsh input

A full node that wants to verify this transaction needs to determine the
type of output being spent (<<fig1024>>). It looks at the output, finds
the pattern `<version byte> <2 to 40 bytes data>`, and concludes that
this is a segwit output. The next thing to check is the value of the
version byte.

The version byte is `00`. A version `00` segwit output can have two
different lengths of the witness program, 20 or 32 bytes. We covered the
first one in the previous sections on p2wpkh. The witness program in
this example is 32 bytes, which means this is a p2wsh output.

[[fig1024]]
.Preparing to verify the p2wsh input
image::{imagedir}/10-24.svg[{full-width}]

Special rules apply when spending a p2wsh output. First, the data items
in the spending input’s witness field are pushed onto the program stack.
Then, the top item on the stack, the witness script, is verified against
the witness program in the output (<<fig1025>>).

[[fig1025]]
.Verifying the witness of a p2wsh payment
image::{imagedir}/10-25.svg[{big-width}]

The witness script is hashed and compared to the witness program in the
spent output before being executed with the three items on the stack.
This process is similar to that of verifying a p2sh payment.

Miners and block verifiers handle all segwit transactions the same way,
so there’s no difference in how the transaction is included in a block
compared to p2wpkh transactions.

[[new-hashing-algorithm]]
==== New hashing method for signatures

[.inbitcoin]
.BIP143
****
This solution is specified in BIP143, “Transaction Signature
Verification for Version 0 Witness Program.”
****

One problem that segwit solves is inefficient signature hashing. As
explained in <<inefficient-sighash>>, if the number of inputs doubles,
the time it takes to verify the transaction roughly quadruples. This
is because you

* Double the number of signatures to verify

* Double the transaction’s size

[.inbitcoin]
.This algorithm is simplified
****
In reality, three different intermediate hashes are created: one for
all outpoints, one for all sequence numbers, and one for all outputs.
However, the effect is the same. Read BIP143 for details.
****

If you double the number of hashes performed _and_ double the amount
of data each hash needs to process, you effectively quadruple the
total time spent on hashing.

The solution is to make the signatures in steps. Suppose you want to
sign all four inputs of a transaction, as <<fig1026>> shows.

[[fig1026]]
.Hashing is done in two steps. The intermediate hash is reused for each input.
image::{imagedir}/10-26.svg[{full-width}]

First you create an intermediate hash of the complete transaction. If
the transaction contains non-segwit inputs, those signature scripts
will be cleaned prior to hashing. The intermediate hash commits to all
of that transaction’s inputs and outputs. Then, for each input, add
the intermediate hash to some input-specific data:

* _Spent outpoint_—The txid and index of the output this input spends

* _Spent script_—The witness script or p2wpkh script corresponding to
the spent output
* _Spent amount_—The BTC value of the spent output

.Old hashing
****
image::{imagedir}/u10-02.svg[]
****

The bulk of the transaction is hashed only once to create the
intermediate hash. This drastically reduces the amount of hashing
needed. When the number of inputs doubles, the needed amount of hashing
only doubles. This makes the hashing algorithm perform _linearly with
the number of inputs_ instead of _quadratically_. The time to verify
the transaction with 1,024 inputs discussed in <<fig1007>> is reduced
from 262,144 ms to 512 ms.

===== Signature commits to amount

Why do we include the spent amount? We didn’t do that in the old
signature-hashing algorithm. This has nothing to do with hashing
efficiency, but it fixes yet another problem that offline wallets and
some lightweight wallets face.

[.gbinfo]
.Hardware wallets
****
A _hardware wallet_ is an electronic device designed to keep private
keys safe. Unsigned transactions are sent to the device for
signing. The device usually requires a PIN code to sign.
****

An offline wallet—for example, a hardware wallet—can’t know how much
money is being spent. If the offline wallet is to sign a transaction,
the wallet can’t display the transaction’s fee amount to the user
because it can’t see the values of the outputs it’s spending
(<<fig1027>>). It has no access to the blockchain.

[[fig1027]]
.An offline wallet can’t know a transaction’s fee.
image::{imagedir}/10-27.svg[{big-width}]

This is true for both non-segwit and segwit transactions. But with
segwit transactions, when the signatures commit to the spent output
amounts, the wallet must get the amounts from somewhere to be able to
sign. Suppose the input amounts are somehow provided to the offline
wallet, alongside the transaction to sign. The wallet can then sign the
transaction using those amounts and even show the user what fee is being
paid before signing.

If the offline wallet receives the wrong amount, it won’t be able to
tell. It can’t verify the input values. But because the signatures now
cover the amounts, the transaction will be invalid. A verifying node
will know the correct amounts and use them when verifying the
signatures. The signature check will fail. The new signature hashing
algorithm makes it impossible to trick a wallet into signing a valid
transaction with a fee the user didn’t intend.

==== Bandwidth savings

Segwit removes the signature data from the transaction, so when a
lightweight wallet requests a transaction from a full node, the full
node can send the transaction without the witness data. This means
less data traffic is needed per transaction. This fact can be used to
either

* Keep the bloom filter size as is and get about 50% reduction in data
traffic

* Improve privacy by decreasing the size of the bloom filter to get
more false positives without increasing data traffic

==== Upgradable script

The version byte is used for future script language upgrades. Before
segwit, we had to use the ``OP_NOP``s to introduce new features to the
language—for example, `OP_CSV`. This wasn’t optimal for the following
reasons:

* We might run out of ``OP_NOP``s—there are eight left.

* The ``OP_NOP``s can’t be redefined in arbitrary ways; they still
need to behave as ``OP_NOP``s in case the new behavior succeeds.

The version byte allows for much more powerful future upgrades. We can
do anything from slight modifications of specific operators to
implementing completely new languages.

=== Wallet compatibility

Most old wallets won’t support sending bitcoin to a segwit address. They
usually only allow p2pkh and p2sh addresses. So segwit’s developers
created _p2wsh nested in p2sh_ and _p2wpkh nested in p2sh_: ways to
trigger the segwit verification instead of the legacy script
verification.

Suppose you have a segwit wallet and want to sell your popcorn machine
to your neighbor, Nina. But Nina doesn’t have a segwit-aware wallet. She
can only pay to ordinary addresses, like p2pkh and p2sh. You can make a
p2sh address that Nina can pay to (<<fig1028>>).

[[fig1028]]
.Nina sends 0.1 BTC to your segwit wallet using a p2wpkh inside a p2sh address.
image::{imagedir}/10-28.svg[{big-width}]

Nina pays to `3KsJCgA6…k2G6C1Be`, which is an old-style p2sh address
that contains the hash of the redeem script `00 bb4d4977…75ff02d1`. This
redeem script is a version byte `00` followed by a 20-byte witness
program. This is the pattern for p2wpkh, which we covered earlier.
Nina’s wallet knows nothing about this. It sees only a p2sh address and
makes a payment to that script hash.

Later, when you want to spend your output, you create a transaction like
the one in <<fig1029>>.

[[fig1029]]
.You spend the money you got from Nina by setting the version byte and witness program in the redeem script in your input’s signature script.
image::{imagedir}/10-29.svg[{big-width}]

You create a witness, just as you would with a normal p2wpkh input,
but you also set the redeem script as a single data item in the
signature script. The redeem script happens to be a version byte
followed by your 20-byte PKH. Using this signature script, old nodes
can verify that the script hash in the spent output matches the hash
of the redeem script in the signature script. New nodes will detect
that the redeem script is a version byte and a witness program, and
verify the witness accordingly.

This way of nesting a segwit payment inside a p2sh payment can also be
used for p2wsh payments in a similar fashion: a p2wsh nested in p2sh.

[[recap-of-payment-types]]
=== Recap of payment types

summarize the most common ones.

=== Block limits

Bitcoin blocks are limited to 1,000,000 bytes in size and 20,000
signature operations.

[[block-size-limit]]
==== Block size limit

In 2010, the Bitcoin software was updated with a block size limit of
1,000,000 bytes. It isn’t totally clear why this was done, but most
people think the limit was introduced to reduce the impact of certain
denial of service (DoS) attacks. DoS attacks aim at stalling or
crashing Bitcoin nodes so the network can’t function properly.

One way to mess with the network is to create a very large block that
takes 10 seconds to download on a good internet connection. This might
seem fast enough, but uploading this block to five peers will take 50
seconds. This will cause the block to propagate very slowly across the
peer-to-peer network, which will increase the risk of an unintended
blockchain split. Unintended splits will resolve with time, as you saw
in <<draw-lucky-numbers>>, but Bitcoin’s overall security will
decrease during such splits.

Another potential problem with big blocks that attackers could exploit
is that people with poor internet connections will be left out
completely because they can’t keep up with the network, or they don’t
have the required processing power, RAM, or disk storage space needed
to run a full node. These people will need to switch to systems with
less security, such as lightweight wallets, reducing the security of
the whole network.

Regardless of the reason, this limit is in place.

==== Signature operations limit

The signature operations limit was put in place because
signature-verification operations are relatively slow, especially in
non-segwit transactions. An attacker could stuff a transaction with a
tremendous number of signatures, causing verifying nodes to be busy
verifying signatures for a long time. The limit of 20,000 such
operations per block was somewhat arbitrarily chosen to prevent such
an attack.

==== Increasing the limits

It will take a _hard fork_ to remove or increase these limits. A hard
fork is a rule change that causes old nodes and new nodes to disagree
on what the strongest valid blockchain is. We’ll examine forks and
upgrades in <<ch11>>. For now, suppose new nodes decide that
8,000,000-byte blocks are OK. When a miner publishes a block that’s
bigger than 1,000,000 bytes, new nodes will accept it, whereas old
nodes won’t. A permanent blockchain split will occur, and we’ll
effectively have two different cryptocurrencies.

Segwit offers an opportunity to somewhat increase both these limits
without a hard fork.

[[increasing-the-block-size-limit]]
===== Increasing the block size limit

The old rule of 1,000,000 bytes remains, so old nodes can continue
working as they used to. New nodes will count block size differently,
but in a compatible way. Witness bytes will be counted with a “discount”
compared to other bytes, such as the block header or transaction
outputs. A new measurement, _block weight_, is put in place. A block’s
maximum weight is 4,000,000 _weight units_ (WU; <<fig1036>>).

[[fig1036]]
.Witness bytes and nonwitness bytes are counted differently. Witness bytes contribute less to the block weight and not at all to the traditional block size, the base block size.
image::{imagedir}/10-36.svg[{full-width}]

Let’s call the block excluding the witnesses the _base block_:

* 1 byte of base block data is counted as 4 WU.

* 1 byte of witness data is counted as 1 WU.

[role="important"]

The effect is that the old 1,000,000-byte block size limit remains
because the new rule and the old rule are effectively the same on the
base block. But the more segwit is used, the more data can be moved from
the base block to the witnesses, which allows for a bigger total block
size.

Suppose the witnesses in a block account for ratio stem:[r] of the data in
a block. The maximum block weight is 4,000,000, and a total block size
stem:[T] gives

[stem]
++++
4(1-r)T+rT \leq 4*10^{6} \\
(4-3r)T \leq 4*10^{6} \\
T \leq \frac {4*10^{6}} {4-3r}
++++

Inserting various values of stem:[r] into this formula gives different
maximum total block sizes, as <<tab1002>> shows.

[[tab1002]]
.Maximum block sizes for different ratios of witness data
|===
| stem:[r] (witness bytes/total bytes) | Max total block size (bytes)

| 0	| 1,000,000
| 0.1	| 1,081,081
| 0.3	| 1,290,323
| 0.5	| 1,600,000
| 0.6	| 1,818,182
| 0.7	| 2,105,263
| 0.8	| 2,500,000
|===

As the relative amount of witness data increases in the block, we can
squeeze in more transactions. The effect is an actual maximum block
size increase.

The witness discount is implemented for several reasons:

* The signature scripts and witnesses don’t go into the UTXO set. Data
that goes into the UTXO set has higher costs because the UTXO set
should preferably be stored in RAM for fast transaction verification.

* It gives wallet developers, exchanges, and smart contract developers
more incentive to make fewer outputs, which reduces the UTXO set’s
size.  For example, an exchange can choose to consolidate its many
outputs into a few outputs.

* The witnesses don’t have to be sent to a lightweight wallet.

===== Increasing the signature operations limit

Because we’re increasing the block size with segwit, we also need to
increase the number of allowed signature operations; allowing more
transaction data per block should imply that we also need to allow
more signature operations. We can increase the limit in the same
manner as we increased the block size limit.

We increase the number of allowed signature operations from 20,000 to
80,000 and count each legacy signature as four operations and each
segwit operation as one operation. We count a segwit signature
operation less than a legacy operation because the former is more
efficient, as discussed in <<new-hashing-algorithm>>.

This will have the same effect as the block size increase. If a block
contains only legacy inputs, the old limit of 20,000 actual operations
remains. If the block contains only segwit inputs, the new limit of
80,000 actual operations is in effect. Any combination of legacy and
segwit inputs in a block will result in a limit somewhere between
20,000 and 80,000 actual signature operations.

=== Recap

This chapter has walked through segregated witness, which solves some
problems:

* _Transaction malleability_—A txid might change without changing the
effect of its transaction. This can cause broken links between
transactions, making the child transaction invalid.

* _Inefficient signature verification_—As the number of inputs doubles
in a transaction, the time to verify the transaction increases
quadratically. This is because both the transaction’s size and the
number of signatures to verify doubles.

* _Wasted bandwidth_—Lightweight wallets must download the transactions,
including all signatures, to be able to verify the merkle proof, but the
signature data is useless to them because they don’t have the spent
outputs to verify against.

* _Hard to upgrade_—There is limited room for script language
upgrades.  A handful of ``OP_NOP``s are left, and you can’t change an
`OP_NOP` however you please. If the new operator behavior succeeds, it
must behave exactly as an `OP_NOP`.

==== Solutions

By moving signature data out of the base transaction, that data will no
longer be part of the txid.

image::{imagedir}/u10-03.svg[{big-width}]

If the signature is malleated, it won’t affect the txid. Unconfirmed
chains of transactions become unbreakable.

A new signature-hashing algorithm is used that makes the verification
time grow _linearly_ with the number of inputs. The old
signature-hashing algorithm hashes the entire transaction for each
signature.

image::{imagedir}/u10-04.svg[{big-width}]

Signatures in witnesses will hash the transaction only once.

image::{imagedir}/10-26.svg[{full-width}]

The intermediate hash is reused for each signature, which greatly
reduces the total amount of hashing.

The bandwidth that lightweight wallets require decreases because they
don’t have to download the witnesses to verify that a transaction is
included in a block. They can use the per-transaction savings to
increase their privacy by decreasing their bloom filter size or to
reduce data traffic with preserved privacy.

The witness version in the pubkey script allows for future upgrades of
the script language. These upgrades can be arbitrarily complex with no
restrictions on functionality.

New rules apply for blocks containing segwit transactions. An output in
the coinbase transaction must commit to all the block’s witnesses.

image::{imagedir}/u10-06.svg[{full-width}]

Old nodes will still work because they aren’t aware of the commitment in
the coinbase transaction. This let us introduce segwit without
disrupting, or splitting, the blockchain into two separate
cryptocurrencies.

=== Summary

* Segwit moves signature script data out of transactions to solve
transaction malleability issues.

* Segwit uses a new signature-hashing algorithm that makes transaction
verification faster. This helps nodes stay up to date with less
resources.

* Lightweight wallets get better privacy with preserved data traffic
by not downloading witness data.

* The witness version byte of the pubkey script makes upgrading the
script language easier.

* We can increase the maximum block size somewhat by counting witness
bytes with a discount.

* A new address format helps wallets distinguish between legacy
payments and segwit payments.

* Segwit can be “embedded” in old-style p2sh addresses to let old
wallets send money to segwit wallets.
