This chapter covers

* Automating payments

* Creating and managing keys

* Making simple, secure key backups

So far, we’ve done nothing to improve the user experience for the
company’s coworkers using the cookie token spreadsheet. The situation
has become worse for users because emails to Lisa now need more
information than in the beginning. On top of this, users should take
extra steps to use multiple addresses to preserve their privacy.

In this chapter, we’ll build a mobile app, called a _wallet_
(<<fig0401>>), that handles many of the common tasks users want to
perform. This wallet will create new addresses, store private keys,
simplify how addresses are transferred between users, and automate the
payment process.

[[fig0401]]

We’ll discuss different approaches to wallet backups. We’ll also look
at a new way to generate keys, called _hierarchical deterministic
wallets_ (HD wallets), so backups become dead simple; you only need to
back up a single random number, called a _seed_, once and
for all. We’ll finish the chapter with an optional deep dive into the
math behind public key derivation.

This chapter won’t change anything regarding Lisa’s work or the
spreadsheet. We focus only on users here.

=== First wallet version

[.inbitcoin]
.Bitcoin wallets
****
Several different wallets are available for Bitcoin. Some popular ones are

[.movingtarget]
* Bitcoin Core
* Electrum
* GreenBits
* BRD (Bread)

See <<web-bitcoin-wallets>> for a comprehensive list.
****

Among you and your coworkers, a group of software developers builds a
mobile app called a _wallet_ to simplify common tasks for themselves
and other users. The group identifies the following tasks as the most
common:


Create new addresses:: Users must create new cookie token addresses
every now and then. They might want to use different addresses for
different purposes or even different addresses for all payments for
privacy and security reasons.

Manage private keys:: For each address created, the wallet needs to
store and manage the corresponding private key. Keeping private keys
safe from intruders is a delicate task.

Transfer payment details from payee to payer:: When John wants to buy
a cookie, he needs to get the cafe’s address and the payment amount into
his app. Writing it by hand is cumbersome and error-prone, so it would
be nice if John could scan the details with his camera instead.

Make a payment:: The app should be able to send an email to Lisa with
the digitally signed payment details.

Keep track of funds:: Users want to know how many cookies they can
afford. The app should display the total number of cookie tokens a user
has.

Back up private keys:: When private keys are created in the app, they
only exist in the app. If the mobile phone is lost or broken, the
private keys are gone. You know by now what happens when you lose your
keys, don’t you? You need a backup facility for private keys.

The development team builds an initial version of the app and calls it
the wallet. The term _wallet_ isn’t perfect because the app doesn’t
really contain money. It contains the keys needed to spend money. The
actual money is stored in the spreadsheet. The app is more akin to a
physical keyring; but the term _wallet_ is widely used in the Bitcoin
world for all things that store private keys, so we should get over it
and move on. Let’s go through this wallet’s features.

Suppose, once again, that John wants to buy a cookie in the cafe
(<<fig0402>>). Both John and the cafe are using this new app.

[[fig0402]]
.John buys a cookie using the wallet app. The cafe generates a key and displays to John a QR code with payment details. John scans the payment details and taps OK to approve the payment. John’s wallet sends an email to Lisa.
image::{imagedir}/04-02.svg[{full-width}]

The process goes through several steps:

.QR codes
****
Quick response (QR) codes are a way to make text scan-able. This QR code
says “Hello”:

image::{imagedir}/u04-01.svg[]
****

. The cafe asks its wallet to create a new address and request 10 CT
to that address. This new address and the amount are displayed on the
screen as a QR code. The QR code contains information on how much to
pay, so John doesn’t have to type that in manually.

. John points his phone’s camera at the QR code to scan the payment
details. It scans the _payment URI_ (uniform resource identifier, a
general specification on how to identify stuff; a web URL is an
example of a URI):

 ct:19UzNFW4Fq8wm8mtWmoPZAzE3tcB9tZVtN?amount=10

This tells John’s phone to launch the cookie token wallet (`ct:`) and
pay 10 (`amount=10`) cookie tokens to the address
`19UzNFW4Fq8wm8mtWmoPZAzE3tcB9tZVtN`.

. John’s wallet displays the payment details to John, who checks that
they’re reasonable and clicks OK.

[.inbitcoin]
.BIP21
****
BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals) are used to communicate ideas
among developers. Some BIPs are adopted in Bitcoin software projects;
others aren’t. All BIPs are available at <<web-bips>>.

Bitcoin adopted BIP21 as a way to transfer payment details from one
wallet to another using a URI. Bitcoin URIs start with `bitcoin:`
instead of `ct:`.
****

[start=4]
. John’s wallet creates an email to Lisa that looks the same as
before.  The wallet automatically selects an address to send from and
signs the message with the correct private key. On Lisa’s side,
nothing has changed. She verifies and executes the payment exactly as
before.

Let’s take a closer look at what John’s wallet does in step 4
(<<fig0403>>). The wallet does the same thing a user would do manually
in the earlier examples.

[[fig0403]]
.John has just clicked OK in his wallet to approve the payment. The wallet takes care of the rest. It selects a key with enough funds and signs a message to Lisa. It then automatically emails the signed message to Lisa.
image::{imagedir}/04-03.svg[{big-width}]

Notice that the wallet manages three key pairs: two with funds and one
with no funds. With this new wallet, users can have as many addresses
as they want, which is good for privacy. The wallet will keep track of
them for the user.

The cafe’s wallet, as well as John’s wallet, will check the spreadsheet
every now and then to see if there are any new payments concerning any
of the wallet’s keys, as a sender, a recipient, or both (<<fig0404>>).

[[fig0404]]
.John’s and the cafe’s wallets check the spreadsheet every few seconds. If a new payment, either incoming or outgoing, is found, the wallet updates the balance of the concerned keys and notifies its user.
image::{imagedir}/04-04.svg[{big-width}]

[.inbitcoin]
.Unconfirmed transactions
****
_Unconfirmed_ means a transaction is created and sent to the Bitcoin
network, but it isn’t yet part of the Bitcoin blockchain. You shouldn’t
trust a payment until it’s part of the blockchain. The same goes for
cookie token payments—don’t trust payments that aren’t in the
spreadsheet.
****

Even though John knows about the payment before Lisa confirms it in
the spreadsheet, his wallet won’t update the balance until it’s
confirmed.  Why? Lisa might not approve the payment. Maybe the payment
became corrupted during transfer, or the email ended up in Lisa’s spam
folder, so she doesn’t see it.

If the wallet updates the balance without first seeing it in the
spreadsheet, it could give false information to John. The wallet
could, of course, be kind enough to inform John that a payment is
pending confirmation.

=== Private key backups

The development team creates a feature to back up the wallet’s private
keys. The idea is that the wallet creates a text file, the backup file,
with all private keys in it and sends this file to an email address the
user chooses.

[.gbinfo]
.Why back up?
****
Your keys hold your money. If you lose your keys, you lose your
money. A proper backup is _not_ optional. You must take immediate,
active steps to make sure your keys are backed up; otherwise you will
sooner or later lose your money.
****

Imagine that John wants to back up his private keys. The wallet collects
all the keys it has ever created and writes them into a text file
(<<fig0405>>).

[[fig0405]]
.John backs up his private keys. They’re sent in a text file to his email address.
image::{imagedir}/04-05.svg[{half-width}]

The text file is emailed to John’s email address. Can you see any
problems with this? Yes, the biggest problem is that the keys have
left the privacy of the wallet application and are being sent into the
wild.  Anyone with access to the email server or any other systems
involved might be able to get the private keys without John noticing.

.Problems
****
* Risk of theft
* Excessive backups
****

But another problem exists. As soon as John creates a new address
after the backup is made, this new address isn’t backed up. John must
make a new backup that includes the new key. For every new key, he
must make a new backup. Doing backups for every address becomes
tiresome for the user.

Let’s look at a few simple solutions to these two problems:

1. Automatically send a backup when an address is created. This
increases the risk of theft because you send more backups.

2. Pre-create 100 addresses, and make a backup of them. Repeat when
the first 100 addresses are used. This also increases the risk of
theft, but not as much as solution 1.

3. Encrypt the backup with a password. This will secure the backed-up
keys from theft.

A combination of solutions 2 and 3 seems like a good strategy; you
seldom need to do a backup, and the backups are secured by a strong
password.

The process is similar to the previous process, but this time John
enters a password that’s used to encrypt the private keys
(<<fig0406>>).  If John loses his phone, he needs the password and the
backup file to restore his private keys.

[[fig0406]]
.John backs up his private keys. They’re sent in a file encrypted with a password that John enters into his phone.
image::{imagedir}/04-06.svg[{half-width}]

If John loses his phone, he can easily install the wallet app on
another phone. John sends the backup file to the app and enters his
password; the keys are decrypted from the backup file and added to his
wallet app.


==== A few words on password strength

A password’s strength is measured in _entropy_. The higher the
entropy, the harder it is to guess the password. The word _entropy_,
as used in information security, comes from thermodynamics and means
disorder or uncertainty. Suppose you construct a password of 8
characters from among the following 64 characters:

 ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/

****
image::{imagedir}/u04-03.svg[]
****

Each character in the password would then represent 6 bits of entropy
because there are 64 = 2^6^ possible characters. If you select the 8
characters randomly (no cherry-picking, please!), say `E3NrkbA7`, the
eight-character password will have 6 × 8 = 48 bits of entropy. This is
equivalent in strength to 48 coin flips.

****
image::{imagedir}/u04-02.svg[]
****

Suppose instead that you select random words from a dictionary of
2^11^= 2,048 words. How many words do you need to use to beat the
48-bit entropy of your eight-character password? Four words wouldn’t
be enough because 4 × 11 = 44 bits of entropy. But five words
corresponds to 55 bits of entropy, which beats the password’s entropy.

A password’s real entropy also depends on what an attacker knows about
the password. For example, suppose an attacker, Mallory, steals John’s
encrypted backup file and tries to perform a brute-force attack
on it. A _brute-force_ attack means the attacker makes repeated
password guesses, over and over, until they find the correct
password. If Mallory knows the password’s length is exactly 8 and the
characters are chosen from the 64 characters mentioned, the entropy is
48 bits. If she happens to know that the second character is `3`, the
entropy drops to 6 × 7 = 42 bits. On the other hand, if Mallory
doesn’t know how many characters the password has, it will be harder
for her, meaning the entropy will be higher.

This is true only if password selection is truly random. If John uses
cherry-picking to select the password `j0Hn4321`, the entropy
decreases dramatically. Typical password brute-force attack programs
first try a lot of known words and names in different variations
before trying more “random-looking” passwords. John is a well-known
name, so an attacker will try a lot of different variations of that
name as well as many other names and words. For example:

----
butter122 … waLk129 … go0die muh4mm@d
john John JOhn JOHn JOHN j0hn j0Hn
jOhn jOHn jOHN … john1 …
… john12 J0hn12 … j0Hn321 …
j0Hn4321
----

Bingo! Suppose there are 1,000,000 common words and names, and each word
can come in 100,000 variations, on average. That’s 100 billion different
passwords to test, which corresponds to about 37 bits of entropy; 100
billion tries will take a high-end desktop computer a few days to
perform. Let’s say, for simplicity, that it takes one day. If John uses
a truly random password, the entropy for the attacker is around 48 bits.
It would take around 2,000 days, or about 5.5 years, to crack the
password.

==== Problems with password-encrypted backups

The process for password-encrypted backups works pretty well, but it
also introduces new problems:

****
image::{imagedir}/u04-04.svg[]
****

More things to secure:: John now needs to keep track of two things: a
backup file and a password. In the first version, only a backup file was
needed.

****
image::{imagedir}/u04-05.svg[]
****

Forgotten password:: Passwords that are rarely used, as is the case
with backup passwords, will eventually be forgotten. You can write them
down on paper and store them in a safe place to mitigate this issue. You
can also store them using password-manager software, such as LastPass or
KeePass.

****
image::{imagedir}/u04-06.svg[]
****

Technology advancements:: As time passes, new, more advanced hardware
and software is built that makes password cracking faster. If your
eight-character password was safe five years ago, it’s not good enough
today. Passwords need more entropy as technology improves. You can
re-encrypt your backup files every two years with a stronger password,
but that’s a complicated process that few users will manage.

****
image::{imagedir}/u04-07.svg[]
****

Randomness is hard:: Coming up with random passwords is really hard.
When the app asks John for a password, he needs to produce one on the
spot. He doesn’t have time to flip a coin 48 times to produce a good
password. He will most likely make up something with far less entropy.
One way to deal with this is to have the wallet give John a generated
password. But this password is likely harder to remember than a
self-invented password, which will increase the likelihood of a
forgotten password.

It seems you haven’t yet come up with a good way of dealing with
backups. Let’s not settle for this half-bad solution—there are better
approaches.

=== Hierarchical deterministic wallets

[.inbitcoin]
.BIP32
****
This section describes a standard called BIP32, which is widely used
by various Bitcoin wallet software. The BIPs are available online from
<<web-bips>>.
****

One of the brighter developers at the company, a cryptographer, comes
up with a new way to handle key creation to improve the backup
situation and bring totally new features to wallets.



[role="important"]
She realizes that if all private keys in a wallet were generated from
a single random number called a _random seed_, the whole wallet
could be backed up by writing down the seed on a piece of paper and
storing it in a safe place (<<fig0407>>).

[[fig0407]]
.Backing up a seed. This is how you want to make backups.
image::{imagedir}/04-07.svg[{big-width}]

She talks to some other cryptographers, and they decide on a strategy.
They’re going to make an HD wallet. Basically, keys are organized as a
tree, in which one key is the root of the tree, and this root can have
any number of child keys. Each child key can in turn have a large
number of children of its own, and so on.

[.inbitcoin]
.BIP44
****
BIP44, Multi-Account Hierarchy for Deterministic Wallets, describes
which branches of the tree are used for which purposes. For now, let’s
use Rita’s chosen key organization.
****

Suppose Rita wants to organize her keys based on their purpose and
generate five keys to use for shopping at the cafe and another three
keys to use as a savings account. <<fig0408>> shows how her keys could
be organized.

[[fig0408]]
.Rita creates two accounts, with five addresses in the shopping account and three addresses in the savings account.
image::{imagedir}/04-08.svg[{half-width}]

The keys are organized as a tree, but it’s a tree turned upside down
because that’s how computer geeks typically draw their trees. Anyway,
the root key of the tree (at the top) is called the _master private
key_. It’s the key from which all the rest of the keys are
derived. The master private key has two _child keys_: one that
represents the shopping account (left, in <<fig0408>>) and one that
represents the savings account (right). Each of these children has, in
turn, its own children. The shopping account key has five children,
and the savings account key has three children. These eight children
have no children of their own, which is why they’re called _leaves_ of
the tree. The leaves are the private keys Rita uses to store cookie
tokens, so an address is generated from each of these eight private
keys.

[.gbinfo]
.Indexes
****
Computer programmers often use the term _index_ to denote a position
in a list. It’s usually zero-based, meaning the first item in the list
has index 0, the second item has index 1, and so on. We’ll use
zero-based indexes throughout this book.
****

Note how the keys in the tree are numbered. Each set of children is
numbered from 0 and upwards. This is used to give each key a unique
identifier. For example the first, _index_ 0, savings key is denoted
`m/1/0`. `m` is special and refers to the master private key.

How is a tree structure like this accomplished? Let’s look closer at
the creation of some parts of the tree.

Three important processes are performed to create the tree, as
<<fig0409>> shows:

[[fig0409]]
.Creating the first two of Rita’s three savings keys. A random seed is used to create a master extended private key, which is then used to create child extended private keys.
image::{imagedir}/04-09.svg[{big-width}]

1. A random seed of 128 bits is generated. This seed is what the whole
tree grows up (um, down) from.

2. The _master extended private key_ is derived from the seed.

3. The descendant _extended private keys_ of the master extended
private key are derived.

An _extended private key_ (xprv) contains two items: a private key and a
chain code (<<fig0410>>).

[[fig0410]]
.An xprv consists of a private key and a chain code.
image::{imagedir}/04-10.svg[{half-width}]

The private key is indistinguishable from an old-type private key
generated directly from a random number generator. You can use it to
derive a public key and a cookie token address. You usually make
addresses only out of leaves, but you could use internal keys as well.
The other part of the xprv is the chain code. A chain code is the
rightmost 256 bits of a 512-bit hash, hence the right-half hash icon
in the figure. You’ll see soon how that hash is created. The chain
code’s purpose is to provide entropy when generating a child xprv. The
master xprv doesn’t differ from other xprvs, but we give it a special
name because it’s the ancestor of all keys in the tree. It is,
however, created differently.

****
image::{imagedir}/u04-08.svg[]
****

In step 1, the random seed is created in the same way as when you
created private keys in <<ch02>>. In this example, you generate 128
bits of random data, but it could just as well be 256 bits depending
on the level of security you want—128 bits are enough for most users.
You’ll see later how the choice of seed size will affect the backup
process; a longer seed means more writing on a piece of paper during
backup. We’ll get back to this in <<back-to-backup>>.

Steps 2 and 3 deserve their own subsections.

[[deriving-master-xprv]]
==== Deriving a master extended private key

****
image::{imagedir}/u04-09.svg[]
****

Let’s look deeper into how to generate the master xprv (<<fig0411>>).

[[fig0411]]
.Deriving Rita’s master xprv. The seed is hashed with HMAC-SHA512. The resulting hash of 512 bits is split into the left 256 bits, which become the master private key, and the right 256 bits, which become the chain code.
image::{imagedir}/04-11.svg[{big-width}]

[.gbinfo]
.“CT seed”?
****
An HMAC needs two inputs: a value to hash and a key. You don’t have or
need a key for the master xprv because you have all the entropy you
need in the seed.  In <<fig0411>>, you input `CT seed` to give the
HMAC _something_. A key is needed later, when you derive children of
the master xprv.
****

To create the master private key, the seed is hashed using HMAC-SHA512
(HMAC is short for Hash Based Message Authentication Code), which
produces a 512-bit hash value. HMAC-SHA512 is a special cryptographic
hash function that, besides the normal single input, also takes a key.
From a user’s perspective, you can regard HMAC-SHA512 as a normal
cryptographic hash function but with multiple inputs. The hash value
is split into the left 256 bits and the right 256 bits. The left 256
bits become the master private key, which is a normal private key;
it’s called the _master_ private key because all other private keys
are derived from this single private key (and the chain code). The
right 256 bits become the _chain code_, used in the next step to
derive children from the master xprv.

==== Deriving a child extended private key

****
image::{imagedir}/u04-10.svg[]
****

You just created Rita’s master xprv. It’s time to derive the child xprv
that groups together her three savings keys. The direct children of an
xprv can be derived in any order. Let’s derive the savings account key,
`m/1`, first. The process for deriving a child xprv from a parent xprv
is as follows (<<fig0412>>):

[[fig0412]]
.Deriving a child xprv from a parent xprv. The parent’s public key and chain code and the desired index are hashed together. The parent private key is added to the left half of the hash, and the sum becomes the child private key. The right half becomes the child chain code.
image::{imagedir}/04-12.svg[{full-width}]

. The desired index is appended to the parent public key.
. The public key and index become the input to HMAC-SHA512. The parent
chain code acts as a source of entropy to the hash function. To
simplify, think of it as three pieces of data are hashed together.
****
image::{imagedir}/u04-11.svg[]
****
[start=3]
. The 512-bit hash value is split in half:
** The left 256 bits are added, with normal addition (modulo 2^256^), to
the parent private key. The sum becomes the child private key.
** The right 256 bits become the child chain code.
. The child private key and the child chain code together form the child
xprv.

This same process is used for all children and grandchildren of the
master xprv until you have all the keys Rita wanted in her wallet.

You might be wondering why you need the addition—why not use the left
256 bits as the child private key? The 512-bit hash is calculated from
the public key and the chain code—collectively called the _extended
public key_ (xpub)—and an index. You’ll see later how to use the xpub
in less secure environments, such as a web server, to generate a
corresponding tree of _public_ keys. You need to add the parent
private key to the left 256 bits to make it impossible for someone
with the xpub to generate child private keys.

[.periscope]
=== Where were we?

Let’s recall why you’re here: to create a wallet app that makes life
easier for end users (<<fig0413>>).

[[fig0413]]
.You’re working on making a great wallet for users.
image::{imagedir}/04-13.svg[{full-width}]

The main duties of a wallet are to

* Manage private keys
* Create new addresses
* Transfer payment details from payee to payer
* Make a payment
* Keep track of funds
* Back up private keys

We’ve covered the first five items, but we aren’t quite finished with
backups. We just looked at xprv derivation, which is the groundwork for
better backups.

[[back-to-backup]]
=== Back to backup

.But the key paths?
[.inbitcoin]
****
To restore keys, you also need their paths. In Bitcoin, those paths
are standardized in BIP44. If a wallet uses that standard, you
implicitly know the keys’ paths.
****

You want a safe, easy way to back up private keys. You’ve created an HD
wallet to generate any number of private keys from a single seed. What’s
the minimum Rita needs to back up to restore all keys in her wallet,
should she lose it? Right: the seed (and the tree structure, see
margin). As long as her seed is safe, she can always re-create all her
keys.

Suppose Rita’s 128-bit (16-byte) seed is

 16432a207785ec5c4e5a226e3bde819d

****
image::{imagedir}/u04-13.svg[]
****

It’s a lot easier to write these 32-hex digits on a piece of paper than
it would be to write her eight private keys. But the biggest win is that
Rita can write this down once and lock it in a safe. As long as that
paper is safe, her wallet is safe from accidental loss. She can even
create new keys from the same seed without having to make another
backup.

But it’s still difficult to write this down without any typos. What if
Rita makes a typo and then loses her wallet? She won’t be able to
restore any of her keys! You need something even simpler that’s more
compatible with how humans work.

==== Mnemonic sentences

[.inbitcoin]
.BIP39
****
Most Bitcoin wallets use mnemonic sentences for backup. This is
standardized in BIP39. Before that, wallets typically used
password-protected files with all keys, which caused a lot of
headache.
****

Recall that the seed is a sequence of bits. For example, Rita’s seed
is 128 bits long. What if you could encode those bits in a more
human-friendly way? You can!

Rita’s wallet used to create a seed using a random number generator,
in the most straight-forward way possible. But if it had done it in a
slightly different way, it could display her seed as a sequence of 12
English words, called a _mnemonic sentence_:

 bind bone marine upper gain comfort
 defense dust hotel ten parrot depend

****
image:{imagedir}/u04-14.svg[]
****

[role="important"]
This mnemonic sentence presents the seed in a human-readable way. It’s
much more approachable to write down 12 words than it is to write down
cryptic hex code. If Rita loses her wallet, she can install the wallet
app on another phone and restore the seed from those 12 words. Rita
can regenerate all her private keys from that seed.

This is a three-step process as shown in <<fig0414>>.

[[fig0414]]
.The three steps involved to create a seed from a random number generator.
image::{imagedir}/04-14.svg[{half-width}]

First, a random number is generated. Second, the mnemonic sentence,
that can be used for backup, is generated from the random number. In
the last and third step, you generate a seed from the mnemonic
sentence. The last two steps are discussed more in detail in the next
two subsections.

==== Generating a mnemonic sentence

WARNING: We’re going to explore how the mnemonic sentence and seed
generation works. It’s really fun, but if you think this section goes
too deep, you can accept the previous section and skip to
<<extended-public-keys>>.

The encoding starts with the random number, as shown in
<<fig0415>>. The random number is hashed with SHA256, and the first 4
bits of the hash—in this case, `0111`—are appended to the random
number. Those 4 bits act as a checksum.  You then arrange the bits
into 12 groups of 11 bits, where each group encodes a number in the
range 0 to 2047. Eleven bits can encode 2^11^ = 2,048 different
values, remember?

[[fig0415]]
.Generating a 12-word mnemonic sentence from a random number. The random number is checksummed, and every group of 11 bits is looked up in a word list of 2,048 words.
image::{imagedir}/04-15.svg[{big-width}]

The 12 numbers are looked up in a standardized word list of 2,048
words numbered from 0 to 2047. You can find this list in BIP39 from
<<web-bips>>; it contains commonly used English words. After looking
up all 12 numbers, the result is the mnemonic sentence.

The sentence doesn’t mean anything in particular. It’s 12 random words,
just like the hex-encoded seed is 32 random hex digits.

Rita’s wallet shows the mnemonic sentence to her, and she writes the 12
words down on a piece of paper. She puts the paper in a safe place and
gets on with her life.

==== Generating a seed from a mnemonic sentence

Rita’s wallet doesn’t stop there. It has yet to generate a seed that
it can use to generate addresses for Rita. The wallet will generate
the seed in many steps (<<fig0416>>).

[[fig0416]]
.A seed is generated from a mnemonic phrase in 2048 steps.
image::{imagedir}/04-16.svg[{big-width}]

The mnemonic sentence is used as the main input for each of the 2048
HMAC-SHA512 functions. This is the same function as we used in
<<deriving-master-xprv>> to generate a master xprv from the seed. The
other input, which is called the key, is `mnemonic1` in the first,
leftmost, function. For subsequent functions the key input is the
output of the previous function.

The output from each function is added using bitwise XOR (exclusive
or) to form the final result, which is our 512 bit seed. In bitwise
XOR, two numbers are compared bit by bit, and if the bits are equal
the resulting bit is `0`, otherwise `1`. This seed is then used to
generate a master xprv as described in <<deriving-master-xprv>>.

You’re probably wondering why the seed generation uses 2048 steps of
HMAC-SHA512. This process is called _PBKDF2_ (Password-Based Key
Derivation Function 2), which is a standardized way to achieve
so-called key stretching. Key stretching makes brute-force attacking
the mnemonic sentence harder because each try becomes slower due to the
many steps involved.

The next day, Rita drops her phone into the ocean, and it disappears
into the deep. She lost her wallet! But Rita isn’t very concerned. She
buys a new phone and installs the wallet app. She instructs her app to
restore from a backup. The wallet asks her for her mnemonic sentence.
She writes

 bind bone marine upper gain comfort
 defense dust hotel ten parrot depend

into the wallet app. The app uses the 4-bit checksum discussed in the
previous section to make sure it’s correct. It does that by running
the mnemonic sentence generation backwards as <<fig0417>> illustrates.

[[fig0417]]
.Verifying the checksum of a mnemonic sentence
image::{imagedir}/04-17.svg[{big-width}]

If Rita accidentally writes the last word as `deposit` instead of
`depend`, the checksum check will _probably_ fail because she wrote
the wrong word at the end. If she types `depends` instead of `depend`,
the decoding will definitely fail because there’s no word `depends` in
the word list.

The checksum is pretty weak—4 bits make only 16 possible checksums. A
wrongly written mnemonic sentence, in which all words exist in the
word list, would have a 1/16 probability of not being detected. This
seems bad. But the probability that you’d write such a sentence is
small, because your misspelled words have to exist in the word
list. This reduces the risk of an invalid mnemonic sentence being
restored.

After the checksum has been verified, the app regenerates the seed as
shown in <<fig0416>> and all of Rita’s private keys can be restored
from that seed.

=== Extended public keys

****
image::{imagedir}/u04-17.svg[]
****

Rita created her wallet from a random 128-bit seed, which she backed
up with a 12-word mnemonic sentence. Her wallet can create any number
of private keys from that seed. She can organize them into different
“accounts” as she pleases. Very nice. But HD wallets have another
feature: you can create a tree of public keys and chain codes without
knowing any of the private keys.

Suppose the cafe uses an HD wallet. It wants to start selling cookies on
its website and delivering those cookies to coworkers’ cubicles.

For privacy reasons, the web server needs to be able to present a new
cookie token address for every sale, but where does it get the
addresses? The cafe could create an xprv for an _online sales_
account in its HD wallet and put that xprv on the web server, as
<<fig0418>> shows.

[[fig0418]]
.The cafe copies its online sales xprv to the web server.
image::{imagedir}/04-18.svg[{big-width}]

The web server can now create new addresses as the orders pour in.
Great! But what if Mallory, the gangster, gains access to the web
server’s hard drive? She can steal all the money in any of the addresses
in the online sales account. She can’t steal from any other addresses in
the tree. For example, she can’t calculate any key in the _counter
sales_ account because she doesn’t have access to the master xprv, which
is needed to calculate the counter sales account key and all its
children.

Typical web servers are prone to hacking attempts because they’re
usually accessible from anywhere in the world. Storing money on the
web server would probably attract a lot of hacking attempts. Sooner or
later, someone would succeed in getting access to the web server’s
hard drive, and steal the xprv.

For this reason, the cafe wants to avoid having any private keys on
the web server. Thanks to the HD wallet, this is possible by using
xpubs (<<fig0419>>).

[[fig0419]]
.An xpub consists of a public key and a chain code.
image::{imagedir}/04-19.svg[{half-width}]

An xpub is similar to an xprv, but the xpub contains a public key and
a chain code, whereas the xprv contains a private key and a chain
code. An xprv shares the chain code with the xpub. You can create an
xpub from an xprv, but you can’t create the xprv from the xpub. This
is because public key derivation is a one-way function; a public key
can be derived from a private key, but a private key can’t be derived
from a public key.

The cafe puts the xpub `M/1` on the web server. By convention, we use
`M` to denote an xpub path and `m` to denote an xprv path. `M/1` and
`m/1` have the same chain code, but `M/1` doesn’t have the private key,
only the public key. You can create the whole xpub tree from the master
xpub (<<fig0420>>), which means you can generate any and all addresses
without any private key. You can create addresses, but not spend money
from those addresses.

[[fig0420]]
.Generating the tree of xpubs from the master xpub. The general pattern is the same as when generating xprvs, but the child-derivation function differs.
image::{imagedir}/04-20.svg[{big-width}]

This looks exactly like when you generated the tree of xprvs. The
difference is that you have no private keys. As <<fig0421>> shows, the
xpubs are generated differently than the xprvs. Please compare this to
the xprv derivation.

[[fig0421]]
.Xpub derivation. The private key addition from the xprv derivation is replaced by public key “addition.”
image::{imagedir}/04-21.svg[{full-width}]

.xprv derivation
****
image::{imagedir}/u04-18.svg[]
****

This resembles xprv derivation. The difference is what you do with the
left 256 bits of the 512-bit hash. To calculate the child public key,
you treat the left 256 bits as if they were a private key and derive a
public key from them. This public key is then added to the parent
public key using the special _public key addition_ operation. The
result is the child public key. Let’s compare the child public key
derivation to the child private key derivation (<<fig0422>>) from the
point after generating the left 256 bits of the HMAC-SHA512 hash.

[[fig0422]]
.The plus on the private side has a corresponding plus on the public side. The parent private key plus some value is the child private key. The parent public key plus the public key derived from the same value is the child public key.
image::{imagedir}/04-22.svg[{big-width}]

Normal addition is used for the private key. You add a 256-bit number
to the parent private key to get the child private key. But to keep
the result within 256-bit numbers, you use addition _modulo_ 2^256^.

The addition used to derive the child public key isn’t exactly what most
people (including me) are used to. For now, let’s just say this addition
works. We’ll dig deeper into that in <<public-key-math>>.

[[hardened-key-derivation]]
=== Deriving hardened private keys

WARNING: This section is challenging. If you had a hard time
understanding xprv derivation and xpub derivation, I suggest skipping
this section and jumping to <<public-key-math>>. You don’t need this
section to understand the rest of this book.

This section will explain how to prevent a potential security issue
with normal xprv derivation.

The cafe’s online business works well. People are ordering cookies
like crazy! The online sales account grows, with a new public key for
every order. The xpub for the online sales account sits on the web
server, and the xprv is present only in the cafe’s wallet (and in a
locked-away mnemonic sentence).

Suppose Mallory somehow steals the private key `m/1/1`, which contains
only 10 CT. This might seem harmless because that private key has so
little money in it. But it could be worse than that. If Mallory has
also managed to get the xpub for the online sales account from the web
server, she can _calculate the online sales xprv_, as <<fig0423>>
shows.

[[fig0423]]
.Mallory has stolen the private key `m/1/1` from the cafe and the parent xpub from the web server. She can now steal all the money in the online sales account.
image::{imagedir}/04-23.svg[{full-width}]

Remember how the xprv derivation function used normal addition to
calculate a child private key from a parent private key?

[stem] 
++++
\text{"m/1"} + \text{"left half hash of index 1"}=\text{"m/1/1"}
++++

// "m/1" + "left half hash of index 1" = "m/1/1"

You can write this just as well as

[stem] 
++++
\text{"m/1/1"}-\text{"left half hash of index 1"}=\text{"m/1"}
++++

Mallory has everything she needs to calculate the left-half hash for any
child index of `M/1` she pleases, but she doesn’t know which index her
stolen private key has, so she starts testing with index 0:

[stem] 
++++
\text{"m/1/1"} - \text{"left half hash of index 0"} = \text{"a private key"}
++++

She derives the public key from this private key and notices that it
doesn’t match `M/1`, so `0` wasn’t the correct index. She then tries
index `1`:

[stem] 
++++
\text{"m/1/1"} - \text{"left half hash of index 1"} = \text{"another private key"}
++++

This private key derives to the public key `M/1`. Bingo! She has
calculated the private key `m/1` for the online sales account. The xprv
shares the chain code with the xpub, so she also has the xprv for `m/1`,
and she can calculate the private key tree for the account. Mallory
steals all the money from the online sales account. Not good.

Now think about what would happen if Mallory had the master xpub. She
could use the same technique to derive the master xprv from the master
xpub and `m/1/1`. Mallory can re-create all the private keys of all
accounts in the entire wallet. Can you do something to prevent such a
catastrophic scenario? Yes, with _yet another key-derivation
function_! This new key-derivation function is called _hardened xprv
derivation_.

Suppose the cafe wants to prevent Mallory from accessing the master
xprv, even if she got the master xpub and a private key in the online
sales account. The cafe can generate the xprv for the online sales
account using hardened xprv derivation, as <<fig0424>> shows.

.Normal child xprv derivation

[[fig0424]]
.Deriving a hardened child xprv for the online sales account. You use the parent private key as input to the hash function instead of the public key.
image::{imagedir}/04-24.svg[{big-width}]

The apostrophe in `m/1'` isn’t a typo: it’s used to denote hardened
key derivation. The difference is that with hardened key derivation,
you hash the _private_ key instead of the public key. An attacker
can’t do the “minus” trick anymore because the hash is derived from
the parent private key. Mallory can’t calculate the left-half hash to
subtract from the child private key because she doesn’t have the
parent private key. <<fig0425>> illustrates the result.

[[fig0425]]
.The master xpub can’t be used to generate any child keys because `m/0'` and `m/1'` are hardened keys.
image::{imagedir}/04-25.svg[{big-width}]

This also means you can’t derive a hardened child xpub from a parent
xpub. You must have the parent xprv to generate any children, public
or private. The children of `m/1'` can’t be derived as hardened
private keys because that would require the cafe to put the private
key `m/1'` on the online sales web server, which would be
insecure. Using nonhardened leaf keys in the online sales account
makes the cafe vulnerable to an attacker stealing `m/1'/1` and
`M/1'`. If that happens, all funds in the account will be stolen. With
hardened xprv, you solve the case of a stolen `M` and `m/1'/1` but not
the case with a stolen `M/1'` and `m/1'/1`.

[[public-key-math]]
=== Public key math

This section digs deeper into the math behind public keys. We’ll start
by looking at how a public key is derived from a private key using
_public key multiplication_. Later subsections will show why child
xpub derivation, using _public key addition_, works, and how public
keys are encoded in Bitcoin.

==== Public key multiplication

WARNING: I’ll try to explain this topic in simple terms, but if you think it’s
too much, you can skip this section and jump to <<ch04-recap>>.

.Normal public key derivation
****
image::{imagedir}/u04-20.svg[]
****

Think back to when you derived a public key from a private key in
<<ch02>>. I didn’t really tell you _how_ the public key was derived.
I’ll make an attempt here instead.

A public key in Bitcoin is a whole-number solution to this equation:

[stem]
++++
y^2 = x^3 + 7 \mod{(2^{256}-4294968273)}
++++

Many such solutions exist, about stem:[2^{256}] of them, so let’s
simplify by using the solutions to stem:[y^2 = x^3 + 7 \mod{11}]
instead (<<fig0426>>).

[.inbitcoin]
.Bitcoin uses this curve
****
This specific elliptic curve is called _secp256k1_ and is used in
Bitcoin. Plenty of other curves have similar properties.
****

[[fig0426]]
.Whole-number solutions to the elliptic curve stem:[y^2 = x^3 + 7 \mod{11}]. Each such solution is a public key.
image::{imagedir}/04-26.svg[{half-width}]

[.gbinfo]
.Curve? I see only dots.
****
It’s called a _curve_ because in the continuous, real-number world,
the solutions form a curve like this:

image::{imagedir}/u04-21.svg[]
****

The previous equations are examples of a class of equations called
_elliptic curves_, and a solution is often referred to as a _point
on the curve_. You can now calculate a public key, which is a point
on the curve, from a private key. To do this, start at a special
point, stem:[G=(6,5)], on the curve. stem:[G] is somewhat arbitrarily
chosen, but it’s widely known by everybody to be the starting point
for public key derivation. _The public key is the private key
multiplied by stem:[G]._

Suppose your private key is stem:[5]. Then your public key is stem:[5G].

To calculate this multiplication, you need two basic public key
operations: addition and doubling, where doubling can be seen as
adding a point to itself.

To add two points (<<fig0427>>), you draw a straight line that “wraps
around” the edges of the diagram and that intersects your two points
and one third point. This third point is the negative result of the
addition. To get the final result of the addition, take the symmetric
point at the same stem:[x] value.

[[fig0427]]
.Point addition. You add stem:[(x, y)=(6,5)] to stem:[(2, 2)] by drawing a straight line through them that will intersect a third point.
image::{imagedir}/04-27.svg[{half-width}]

[.gbinfo]
.Is there always a third point?
****
Yes, there’s always a line that intersects a third point. It’s one of
the curve’s important properties.
****

The result of stem:[(6, 5) + (2, 2)] is stem:[(7, 8)]. The straight
line between the two points crosses the point stem:[(7, 3)]. The
complement point to stem:[(7, 3)] is stem:[(7, 8)], which is the
result of the addition.

To double a point (<<fig0428>>) is to add it to itself, but there’s no
slope to be calculated from a single point. In this special case, you
calculate the slope from the single point stem:[P=(6,5)] as
stem:[3*x^2*(2y)^{-1} \mod{11} = 2]. The process is almost the same as
adding two different points, but you calculate the slope of the line
differently.

[[fig0428]]
.Point doubling. To double a point P, draw a line through P with a special slope that’s calculated from P. The line crosses another point, stem:[(3,10)]. The complement point stem:[(3, 1)] is the doubling result.
image::{imagedir}/04-28.svg[{half-width}]

Using these two basic operations, adding and doubling, you can derive
the multiplication of stem:[5] and stem:[G]. In binary form, stem:[5] is

[stem]
++++
101_{binary} = 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0
++++

Your public key is then

[stem]
++++
5G = 1*2^2*G + 0*2^1*G + 1*2^0*G
++++

Start in stem:[G] and calculate the resulting public key point by taking
terms from right to left:

[.gbinfo]
.Elliptic curve calculator
****
There’s a nice elliptic curve calculator at
<<web-elliptic-curve-calculator>> that you can play with to get a
better feel for how this works.
****

1. Calculate stem:[2^0*G = 1*G = G]. Easy. Now remember this point.
2. Calculate stem:[2^1*G = 2*G]. This is a point doubling of the
previously remembered point _G_ from step 1. Remember the point. Because
there is a 0 in front of stem:[2^1*G], you don’t do anything with
it—just remember it.
3. Calculate stem:[2^2*G = 2*2*G], which is a doubling of the
previously remembered point stem:[2*G]. Because there is a 1 in front of
the stem:[2^2*G] term, you add this result to the result of step 1.

In short, multiplication is performed by a sequence of adding and
doubling operations.

==== Why is this secure?

The multiplication process is pretty easy to complete; it takes about
256 steps for a 256-bit private key. But to reverse this process is a
totally different story. No known way exists to get the private key by
point “division” (for example, point stem:[(6,6)] “divided by”
stem:[G]). The only known way is to try different private keys and see
if the public key is what you’re looking for. This is what makes
public-key derivation a one-way function.

==== Xpub derivation

You’ve seen how an ordinary public key is derived from a private key
through public-key multiplication. But how can adding the parent public
key with the public key derived from the left 256 bits make the child
public key? See <<fig0429>>.

[[fig0429]]
.The child public key is derived by adding the parent public key with the public key derived from the left 256 bits.
image::{imagedir}/04-29.svg[{half-width}]

You can convince yourself that it works by looking at both normal
public-key derivation and child public-key derivation in the same
picture: see <<fig0430>>.

[[fig0430]]
.Xpub derivation and normal public-key derivation. A normal public key is the starting point _G_ multiplied by a private key. A child public key is the parent public key added to the public key derived from the left-half hash.
image::{imagedir}/04-30.svg[{big-width}]

The nice thing with elliptic curves is that the special public key
“add” operation works a bit like normal add. The same goes for the
special public key “multiplication.” You can thus solve some
equations:

[stem]
++++
c=p+h \\
C=Gh+Gp=G(h+p)=Gc
++++

The result, stem:[C=Gc], is exactly how to derive the public key
stem:[C] from the private key stem:[c].

==== Public key encoding

Do you remember how John’s public key looked like a big number?

 035541a13851a3742489fdddeef21be13c1abb85e053222c0dbf3703ba218dc1f3

That doesn’t look like a pair of coordinates, does it? The public key is
encoded in a certain way. Because of the symmetry, exactly two points
exist for every value of stem:[x], one with an even stem:[y] value and one
with an odd stem:[y] value (<<fig0431>>).

[[fig0431]]
.Each point on the curve has a symmetric point at the same stem:[x] value.
image::{imagedir}/04-31.svg[]

You don’t need to store stem:[y] values, only whether the stem:[y]
value is even or odd. You do this by prefixing the stem:[x] value with
`02` (even) or `03` (odd). In John’s case, the stem:[y] value happens
to be odd, so the prefix is `03`.

This is why public keys are 33 bytes and not 32 bytes. It’s a 256-bit
number—the stem:[x]-coordinate—prefixed by a byte specifying the odd/even
property.

The curve in the figure has a single point stem:[x=5, y=0]. This
doesn’t look symmetric, but it’s a so-called _double-root_ to the
curve—it’s two points with the same stem:[y] value 0. They’re symmetric
because they’re at equal distance 5.5 from the symmetry line. In this
special case, both these points will use `02` because 0 is even.

[[ch04-recap]]
=== Recap

Let’s look back at what you’ve learned in this chapter. An HD wallet
generates a tree of keys from a random seed. It can use key hardening
to isolate different branches of the tree from each other.

****
image::{imagedir}/u04-23.svg[]
****

Users back up their keys by writing the random seed in the form of 12
to 24 English words on a piece of paper and lock it up safely.

The cafe accepts cookie tokens in its online shop. It only puts the
xpub for the online sales account, `M/1'`, on the web server, which
can now create as many addresses as needed without using any private
keys. The private keys are kept in the cafe’s wallet and never touch
the web server.

==== System changes

Our concept table (<<tab0401>>) isn’t updated in this chapter. The
wallets described in this chapter work basically as they do in
Bitcoin, but they send an email to Lisa instead of sending a
transaction across the global Bitcoin network. We’ll get to that in
the next chapter.

`155gWNamPrwKwu5D6JZdaLVKvxbpoKsp5S`. Construct a payment URI to give to
your friend. Hint: in Bitcoin, the URI starts with `bitcoin:` instead of
`ct:`. Otherwise, they’re the same.

wallet that uses mnemonic sentences? You only need to answer this on a
high level.

. What does an xprv consist of?

. What does an xpub consist of?

Exercises 4.7 and 4.8 assume that you read
<<hardened-key-derivation>>. If you skipped that section, you can
skip these exercises, too.

[start=7]
. Suppose you want to make a hardened xprv with index `7` from
`m/2/1`. What information do you need to create `m/2/1/7'`?

. Can you derive xpub `M/2/1/7'` from `M/2/1`? If not, how would
you derive `M/2/1/7'`?

==== Dig in

If you didn’t read <<hardened-key-derivation>>, you can skip exercise
4.11.

[start=11]
. Suggest a better approach your victim could have used to prevent you
from stealing all the money.

****

****

[start=12]
. Say the cafe owner wants employees to have access to the counter
sales account because they must be able to create a new address for
each sale. But they must not have access to the private keys because
the owner doesn’t trust the employees to handle them securely. Suggest
how to achieve this. Hint: a wallet can import an xpub.

. Suppose you work at the cafe and have loaded an xpub into your
wallet. Your colleague Anita has loaded the same xpub into her wallet.
You can both request payments from customers that go into the same
account. How would you notice when Anita has received money into a
previously empty key? Hint: you can create keys ahead of time.

=== Summary

* You usually use a mobile app, called a wallet, to send and receive
money—cookie tokens or bitcoins.

* The wallet creates and stores keys, scans or shows payment details,
sends payments, shows your balance, and backs up keys. You don’t have to
do any of this manually.

* Backups are hard to do right. Password-protected backups suffer from
problems with forgotten passwords, technology improvements, and humans
being lousy random number generators.

* With HD wallets, you back up your random seed and store that seed in a
safe place. Do it only once.

* The seed can be encoded using a mnemonic sentence, which makes it easier
to write down the seed.

* HD wallets generate multiple private keys from a seed and organize them
in a tree structure to improve privacy.

* The tree of public keys—or any of its branches—can be generated from an
xpub. This is useful for insecure environments such as web servers.

* Hardened private key derivation keeps “accounts” compartmental­ized. It
confines an attacker to a single account.
