This chapter covers

* Understanding hard forks and soft forks

* Upgrading Bitcoin safely

* Understanding that users make the rules

To understand this chapter, you should be comfortable with concepts
like the blockchain (<<ch06>>), proof of work (<<ch07>>), and the
peer-to-peer network (<<ch08>>). If you had difficulties with those
chapters, I suggest you revisit them before continuing with this
chapter. Of course, you can also just try to read on anyway.

Bitcoin’s consensus rules can change in two ways: via either a soft fork
or via a hard fork. These two types of changes are fundamentally
different. In <<bitcoin-forks>>, you’ll learn about the differences
between hard and soft forks and about what happens when different nodes
run different consensus rules. You’ll need to understand this before
learning how to safely upgrade Bitcoin’s consensus rules..

Rolling out a consensus rule change over the Bitcoin network can be
difficult. Each Bitcoin node is sovereign, and no one dictates what
software people should run—users decide for themselves. This makes it
hard to roll out, or _deploy_, consensus rule changes without having
broad user and miner support. The _deployment mechanisms_ have evolved
over time, and we’ll go through this evolution and explore the current
state of deployment mechanisms.

As of this writing, most (noncritical) updates to Bitcoin’s consensus
rules have been made via _miner-activated soft forks_, in which miners
signal support and eventually start enforcing the new rules. But this
approach presents some issues—for example, a big miner can veto an
upgrade despite broad user adoption. People are looking to solve this
with _user-activated soft forks_. This means power is where power
belongs: with the people using Bitcoin, the _economic majority_. It’s
the economic majority that ultimately and collectively decides the
consensus rules, and this insight is put into practice with
user-activated soft forks.

[[bitcoin-forks]]
=== Bitcoin forks

_Open source_ software is software that you’re free to download, use,
inspect, change, and redistribute as you please. A lot of the software
you use on a daily basis is probably open source. Maybe you use the
Google Chrome web browser or an Android mobile phone. These are examples
of software built on open source projects.

Open source projects can be _forked_. If you make a copy of the source
code for Linux, make some changes to it, and distribute your new version
of the Linux source code, you have created a _fork_ of the project.

Bitcoin is an open source project that can be forked just like any other
open source project, such as Linux. But in this book, _fork_ will mean
something different.

[.gbinfo]
.Differing definitions
****
People define the term _fork_ in different ways. In this book, I use
the definition that I find best, which is “a change in the consensus
rules.”
****

[.important]

In the Bitcoin context, the term _fork_ means a change in the
consensus rules. The consensus rules define what a valid blockchain is.
When some set of nodes uses the same consensus rules, consensus emerges
among them about what the current unspent transaction output (UTXO)
set—“who owns what”—is. In short, a fork changes the definition of a
valid blockchain.

For example, the rule that limits the block weight to 4,000,000 WU is a
consensus rule. Changing that limit would be a fork. But a relay policy
that prevents transactions with tiny fees from being relayed isn’t part
of the consensus rules. Changing that policy isn’t a fork.

You can change the consensus rules in Bitcoin Core, in a copied version
of Bitcoin Core, or in any alternative Bitcoin full-node software
program. If someone runs your modified program, that person is running a
fork.

We generally categorize forks in Bitcoin as follows (<<fig1101>>):

Hard forks:: A hard fork relaxes the consensus rules. Some blocks that
was considered invalid by Old nodes, will be considered valid by New
nodes. Doubling the maximum allowed block weight would be a hard fork.

Soft forks:: A soft fork tightens the consensus rules. All blocks that
New nodes consider valid will also be considered valid by Old nodes,
but some blocks considered valid by Old nodes will be considered
_invalid_ by New nodes. Reducing the maximum allowed block weight
would be a soft fork.

[[fig1101]]
.Soft forks tighten the consensus rules, whereas hard forks widen them—for example, decreasing the maximum block weight or increasing it, respectively.
image::{imagedir}/11-01.svg[{big-width}]

Changes that don’t change the consensus rules, such as modifying the
color of the graphical user interface or adding a new feature to the
peer-to-peer networking protocol, aren’t Bitcoin forks. But they could
be considered forks of a software project in the traditional sense. From
now on, I’ll use the term _fork_ only to mean a change of consensus
rules.

[.bigside]
****
image::{imagedir}/u11-01.svg[]
****

As an analogy for soft and hard forks, imagine a popular vegetarian
restaurant where lots of vegetarians go to eat. This restaurant has only
one dish on its menu. Think of the restaurant as a miner, the guests as
full nodes, and the meals served as blocks. The restaurant produces
meals that guests eat—the miner produces blocks that full nodes accept.

Imagine that the restaurant changes its dish, as <<tab1101>> shows.

[[tab1101]]
[%autowidth]
.The restaurant can make a hard fork by adding meat to its dish or a soft fork by restricting the food to vegan.
|===
| Vegetarian restaurant serves … | Will guests accept it? | Fork type | Why

| Vegetarian food | Yes | None | Vegetarians eat vegetarian food.
| Nonvegetarian food | no | Hard fork | The rules are _relaxed_. Vegetarians can’t eat here any more.
| Vegan food | Yes | Soft fork | The rules are _tightened_. Vegetarian rules still apply.
|===

If you create a fork, soft or hard, you risk having a chain split if
anyone runs your forked computer program. Some nodes will follow the
strongest chain that’s valid according to the old rules, and some
nodes—those running your software—will follow the strongest chain that’s
valid according to your new rules. The result might be a split in the
blockchain.

We’ll work through a few examples to illustrate what happens in
different scenarios. We’ll start with the simplest case: a change that
doesn’t affect the consensus rules. The name _Bitcoin Old_ will refer to
the previous version of the program, and _Bitcoin New_ will refer to the
changed version of the program. A node running Bitcoin Old is called an
_Old node_, and a _New node_ is a node running Bitcoin New. We’ll
denote data—for example, a block—created by a New node as _a New
block_. Similarly, a transaction created by an Old node will be denoted
as an _Old transaction_.

==== Nonconsensus rule changes

Suppose you want to add a new “feature” to Bitcoin Core’s networking
code. You want to add a new network message type called `kill` that one
Bitcoin node can send to another Bitcoin node. This message’s recipient
node will immediately shut itself down. Only New nodes will know how to
deal with an incoming `kill` message. Old nodes will ignore the—for
them—unknown message (<<fig1102>>).

[[fig1102]]
.Your new message will be accepted by New nodes and ignored by Old nodes.
image::{imagedir}/11-02.svg[{big-width}]

Most people consider your change a huge security risk. They don’t want
their nodes shut down by a random stranger on the internet. You’ll
have a hard time convincing them to use Bitcoin New. You can’t force
this software on anyone; people will have to actively want it and
install it for Bitcoin New to get network-wide adoption.

Stupid changes like the `kill` message won’t make it in the world of
open source.

===== Making something useful instead

[.inbitcoin]
.BIP152
****
This was implemented in Bitcoin Core in 2016 and greatly improved the
block-propagation time in the Bitcoin network. BIP152, “Compact Block
Relay,” describes this in detail. I describe only a simplified version
here.
****

Suppose you invent something useful instead: _compact blocks_. Compact
blocks let a peer send a block to another peer, but without sending the
full block. Instead, this technique uses the fact that the recipient
node has already received most of the transactions in the block.
Remember that a transaction first travels the network during transaction
propagation, then travels the network again during block propagation
once the transaction is confirmed.

When Rashid sends a block to Qi (<<fig1103>>), wouldn’t it be great if
the block didn’t have to contain the transactions Qi already has?
Bandwidth requirements would drop dramatically.

[[fig1103]]
.Qi gets a transaction twice: first during transaction propagation, and then during block propagation.
image::{imagedir}/11-03.svg[{big-width}]

Rashid can instead send just the block header and a list of txids
(<<fig1104>>). Qi can then reconstruct the block from the transactions
she already has in memory and the message from Rashid. In case Qi
doesn’t have one of the transactions, she’ll request them from Rashid.

[[fig1104]]
.Compact blocks in action. Rashid sends just the necessary data to Qi.
image::{imagedir}/11-04.svg[{big-width}]

The protocol starts with Rashid sending Qi a `cmpctblock` message. Qi
will use this message to re-create the block using the transactions she
already has in memory. If she succeeds, she’s done and can start
verifying the block. If she’s missing some transactions, she’ll request
them from Rashid using a `getblocktxn` message containing a list of
those transactions’ indexes. Rashid will then reply with a `blocktxn`
message containing the missing transactions.

Note that this is a simplified version of how it actually works. The
main differences are as follows:

* The `cmpctblock` message can also include some complete transactions—for
example, the block’s coinbase transaction.

* Compact blocks can work in two different modes:

** In high-bandwidth mode, `cmpctblock` messages are sent unsolicited
instead of first using an `inv` or `headers`.

** In low-bandwidth mode, the `cmpctblock` is sent only on request after an
`inv` or `headers` has been received.

* The list of txids sent in the `cmpctblock` messages aren’t full txids,
but shortened versions to save data traffic. They’re still long enough
to almost always uniquely identify the actual transactions used.

This is a really useful change that many people find valuable. You
release your software, and people start using it. Not everybody has to
upgrade to this version. If only one of your peers uses it, you’ll
benefit by running it yourself because the bandwidth requirements
between you and that one peer will decrease. As more and more nodes
start adopting compact blocks, your total bandwidth requirement will
drop even more.

You haven’t made any changes to the consensus rules. Blocks are
verified using your software exactly as before. Old nodes will accept
New blocks and vice versa.

==== Hard forks

[.bigside]
****
image::{imagedir}/u11-02.svg[]
****

As described in <<bitcoin-forks>>, a hard fork is a software change that
relaxes the consensus rules. New blocks, created by New nodes, might be
rejected by Old nodes. In the example with the vegetarian restaurant, a
hard fork would be when the vegetarian restaurant starts to serve meat.

Suppose you create a fork that changes the maximum allowed block
weight—discussed in <<increasing-the-block-size-limit>>—from 4,000,000
WU to 8,000,000 WU. This would allow for more transactions to be
stuffed into each block. On the other hand, a higher limit could
negatively affect some nodes in the Bitcoin network, as we talked
about in <<ch10>>.

Anyhow, you make this change and start using it in the Bitcoin network.
When your node receives a block from a Bitcoin Old node, you’ll accept
it because the block is definitely ≤ 8,000,000 WU; the Old node won’t
create or relay blocks larger than 4,000,000 WU.

Suppose you’re a miner running Bitcoin New. You’re lucky enough to find
a valid proof of work, and you publish your block. This block will
definitely be ≤ 8,000,000 WU, but it might or might not be ≤ 4,000,000
WU. If it is ≤ 4,000,000 WU, it will be accepted by Old nodes. But if
not, Old nodes will reject your block. Your blockchain will diverge from
the Bitcoin Old blockchain. You’ve caused a blockchain split (<<fig1105>>).

[[fig1105]]
.Your node running Bitcoin New is a loser against the Bitcoin Old nodes. Bitcoin Old will discard all of your blocks that violate the ≤ 4,000,000 WU rule.
image::{imagedir}/11-05.svg[{full-width}]

When your New node mines a new block, it might get rejected by the Old
nodes, depending on whether it’s ≤ 4,000,000 WU. For the blocks that are
rejected, you’ll have wasted a lot of electricity and time mining blocks
that don’t make it into the main chain.

But suppose a majority of the hashrate likes your Bitcoin New program
and starts using it instead of Bitcoin Old. What happens then? Let’s see
how it plays out (<<fig1106>>).

When a New node mines a big block, all New nodes will try to extend that
block, but all Old nodes will keep on trying to extend the latest—valid,
according to Old rules—block.

[[fig1106]]
.A majority of the hashrate runs Bitcoin New. It seems to have caused a permanent chain split.
image::{imagedir}/11-06.svg[{big-width}]

New nodes win more blocks over time than Old nodes because they
collectively have more hashrate than Old nodes. It seems like the New
nodes’ branch will stay intact because it gets a reassuring lead in
accumulated proof of work.

New nodes have apparently created a lasting chain split. But if some
miners decide to go back to running Bitcoin Old, or if additional
miners enter the race using Old nodes so that Old gets a majority of
the hashrate again, the New chain might face problems, as <<fig1107>>
shows.

[[fig1107]]
.The Bitcoin New chain is wiped out because the Bitcoin Old chain becomes stronger.
image::{imagedir}/11-07.svg[{full-width}]

When Old nodes have a hashrate majority, they will outperform the New
nodes and eventually catch up with the New nodes and surpass them. New
nodes acknowledge this fact by switching back to mining on the Old
chain. We say that the branch created by the New nodes was wiped out by
a chain reorganization, commonly known as a _reorg_.

===== Wipeout protection

Blocks created by Old nodes in the hard fork just described are always
compatible with New nodes. This means there is a risk for a reorg of the
New chain.

This isn’t the case with all hard forks. Suppose, for example, that you
want to change the proof of work hash function from double SHA256 to
single SHA256. Your New blocks will always be rejected by Old nodes;
and, conversely, Old blocks will always be rejected by New nodes. A
change like this is therefore guaranteed to avoid a reorg by the Old
branch. It’s wipeout-protected by nature—but many changes aren’t.

An example of a change that isn’t wipeout-protected by nature is an
alternative cryptocurrency called _Bitcoin Cash_. It was created
through a hard fork of Bitcoin Core at block height 478559 on 1 August
2017. The main thing Bitcoin Cash did was increase the maximum base
block size and remove segwit from the code. This made the Old chain
compatible with New nodes and vulnerable to wipeout. To protect against
Bitcoin New being wiped out in a reorg, Bitcoin Cash added _wipeout
protection_ by requiring the first block of the split to be bigger than
1,000,000 bytes (1 MB). See <<fig1108>>.

[[fig1108]]
.Bitcoin Cash protects against wipeout by requiring the first block after the chain split to be >1 MB.
image::{imagedir}/11-08.svg[{big-width}]

The result is that Bitcoin New nodes _cannot_ move back to the Bitcoin
Old branch because that branch has a block less than or equal to 1 MB at
height 478559.

==== Soft forks

[.bigside]
****
image::{imagedir}/u11-03.svg[]
****

We’ve discussed soft forks several times throughout this book. A soft
fork is a change in the consensus rules in which New blocks are accepted
by Old nodes. The consensus rules are tightened. In the case with the
vegetarian restaurant, a soft fork would be when the restaurant changes
its food to vegan.

Segwit is an example of a soft fork. The change was carefully designed
so that Old nodes won’t fail in verifying blocks that contain segwit
transactions. All Old nodes will accept any valid New blocks and
incorporate them into the blockchain.

On the other hand, an Old node _could_ create a block that isn’t valid
according to Bitcoin New. For example, a non-segwit miner could include
in its block a transaction that spends a segwit output as if it were an
anyone-can-spend output (<<fig1109>>).

[[fig1109]]
.An Old miner regards a segwit output as anyone-can-spend and adds to the block a transaction that spends it as such.
image::{imagedir}/11-09.svg[{full-width}]

Suppose there is only a single miner with a small hashrate running
Bitcoin New. Also assume that the Old miners produce a block that’s
invalid according to New nodes, as in the earlier example with the
non-segwit transaction. The result would be that the Old nodes build a
block that’s not accepted by the New miner. The New miner would reject
the invalid Old block. This is the point where the blockchain splits in
two (<<fig1110>>).

[[fig1110]]
.The soft fork might cause a chain split if the Bitcoin Old nodes produce a block that Bitcoin New miners don’t accept.
image::{imagedir}/11-10.svg[{big-width}]

In this situation, the Old chain is at risk of being wiped out by a
reorg. Suppose more miners decide to upgrade to Bitcoin New, causing a
hashrate majority to support the New blockchain. After a while, we’ll
probably see a reorg (<<fig1111>>).

[[fig1111]]
.As people adopt Bitcoin New, the branch will cause a reorg for Old nodes.
image::{imagedir}/11-11.svg[{full-width}]

The Bitcoin New branch will become the stronger branch, so the remaining
Old miners will abandon their branch and start working on the same
branch as the New nodes. But as soon as an Old node creates a block
that’s invalid on New nodes, it will lose out on the block reward
because it won’t be accepted on the New branch.

==== Differences between hard and soft forks

Let’s look again at what differentiates soft forks from hard forks, as a
general rule:

* A hard fork _relaxes_ the rules. Increasing the maximum block weight is
a hard fork.

* A soft fork _tightens_ the rules. Segwit is a soft fork.

This is a simple, yet true, distinction. We can summarize the effects
of a chain split caused by a hard fork versus a soft fork as follows:

* _Hard fork_—The New branch might get wiped out in a reorg. Use wipeout
protection to avoid this. The Old branch can’t be wiped out.

* _Soft fork_—The Old branch might get wiped out in a reorg. You can’t
protect the Old branch from a wipeout because that would make this fork
a hard fork. Remember that the definition of a soft fork is that Old
nodes accept New blocks.

=== Transaction replay

Regardless of what causes a chain split, its effects are the same. Users
end up with two versions of their UTXO: one spendable on the Old chain,
and one spendable on the New chain. We effectively have two
cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin Old and Bitcoin New (<<fig1112>>).

[[fig1112]]
.After a chain split, you effectively have two versions of your UTXOs.
image::{imagedir}/11-12.svg[{big-width}]

[.gbinfo]
.Value swings
****
If a chain split occurs, it might have a severe impact on the value of
the bitcoins on the Old branch. The value per coin on the New branch
might or might not be known; it depends on whether those coins are
widely traded yet.
****

Suppose the chain split in <<fig1112>> has occurred, and you want to
pay for a book at an online bookstore. You want to do this using
Bitcoin Old because that’s what the bookstore wants.

You create your transaction and broadcast it. The Old nodes in the
network will accept your transaction because you spend a UTXO that
exists on those nodes. But your transaction is _also valid on New nodes_
because those nodes have the same UTXOs as well (<<fig1113>>).

[[fig1113]]
.Your transaction to the bookstore is valid on both the Bitcoin Old and the Bitcoin New branches.
image::{imagedir}/11-13.svg[{big-width}]

If your transaction propagates to both a New miner and an Old miner, it
will probably end up in both branches of the blockchain. This isn’t what
you intended. Your transactions have been _replayed_ on the Bitcoin New
branch (<<fig1114>>).

[[fig1114]]
.Transaction replay causes you to pay in both currencies.
image::{imagedir}/11-14.svg[{full-width}]

[[replay-protection]]
==== Replay protection

To protect users against replay during a chain split due to a hard fork,
the transaction format on the New chain can be changed in such a way
that the transaction is valid on at most one branch.

When Bitcoin Cash did its chain split, it made sure Old transactions
weren’t valid on New nodes and New transactions weren’t valid on Old
nodes (<<fig1115>>).

[[fig1115]]
.With replay protection, a transaction is valid on only one of the branches.
image::{imagedir}/11-15.svg[{full-width}]

To achieve this, a transaction on the New branch must use a new
`SIGHASH` type, `FORKID`, in transaction signatures. This type doesn’t
do anything, but using it makes the transaction invalid on the Old chain
and valid on the New chain. If a transaction doesn’t use `FORKID`, the
transaction is valid on the Old chain and invalid on the New chain.

Using a new `SIGHASH` type for signatures is, of course, not the only
way to achieve replay protection. Any change that makes transactions
valid on at most one chain will do. You can, for example, require that
New transactions subtract `1` from the input txid. Suppose the UTXO
you want to spend has this txid:

[subs=normal]
 6bde18fff1a6d465de1e88b3e84edfe8db7daa1b1f7b8443965f389d8decac**08**

If you want to spend the UTXO on the Old chain, you use this hash in
the input of your transaction. If you want to spend the UTXO on the
New chain, you use this instead:

[subs=normal]
 6bde18fff1a6d465de1e88b3e84edfe8db7daa1b1f7b8443965f389d8decac**07**

Note that this is just a silly example, not a full-fledged proposal.

// BIP 115 ????		Generic anti-replay protection using Script

[[deployment-mechanisms]]
=== Upgrade mechanisms

All non-urgent upgrades of Bitcoin so far have been made using soft
forks. Doing a soft fork safely is a hard problem, and the mechanisms
used to do them have evolved over time.

The main worry when doing a soft fork is that the blockchain will split
in two and stay that way over a significant time period. If this
happened, we would effectively have two cryptocurrencies.

This would cause confusion: Exchanges would need to decide which branch
they considered to be “Bitcoin” and which branches to support for their
exchange service. Users would need to be made aware that a split had
happened so they could avoid sending money on the wrong branch.
Merchants would have to make sure they charged the currency or
currencies they intended to. A blockchain split might also cause the
cryptocurrency value to change dramatically.

==== Using coinbase signaling—BIP16

When p2sh was introduced in 2012, the Bitcoin community had no
experience in upgrading. It had to come up with a way to avoid a
blockchain split. The community implemented soft-fork _signaling_
using the coinbase. New miners signaled support for p2sh by putting
the string `/P2SH/` into the coinbase of the blocks they produced
(<<fig1116>>).

[[fig1116]]
.A miner signals support for p2sh by writing `/P2SH/` in the coinbase’s signature script.
image::{imagedir}/11-16.svg[{half-width}]

[.inbitcoin]
.User-activated soft fork
****
A deployment method in which users, not just miners, start enforcing
rules has become known as a _user-activated soft fork_. We’ll talk
about this later in this chapter.
****

On a specific day, the Bitcoin developers checked if at least 550 of
the last 1,000 blocks contained `/P2SH/`. They did, so the
developers made a new software release that would start enforcing the
p2sh rules on 1 April 2012, a flag day.

This worked out well; miners quickly adopted the soft fork, and the
entire network upgraded within a reasonable time. No split occurred
because at least 50% of the hashrate had upgraded prior to the
flag day.

==== Using incremented block version number signaling—BIP34, 66, and 65

I haven’t talked about it much before, but the block header comes with a
version (<<fig1117>>). This version is encoded in the first 4 bytes
before the previous block hash.

[[fig1117]]
.The block header contains a block version. The first blocks used version 1.
image::{imagedir}/11-17.svg[{half-width}]

The version is the only thing missing from our previous block headers.
This is the actual 80-byte Bitcoin block header:

----
4 bytes  version
32 bytes previous block id
32 bytes merkle root
4 bytes  timestamp
4 bytes  target
4 bytes  nonce

Total 80 bytes
----

The block version can be used to signal support for certain new
features.

[.inbitcoin]
.BIP34
****
This BIP, “Block v2, Height in coinbase,” describes both how to store
the height in the coinbase and how to deploy the change using version
numbers.
****

The first soft fork deployment using block-version signaling was done
in 2013. This soft fork added a rule that all new blocks must contain
the block’s height in their coinbase transaction (<<fig1118>>).

[[fig1118]]
.BIP34 requires that all blocks contain the block height in the coinbase.
image::{imagedir}/11-18.svg[{big-width}]

The _activation_ of the soft fork was performed in steps using
block-version signaling to avoid a blockchain split:

1. New miners increase the block version from 1 to 2
(<<fig1119>>). Note that this happens gradually as more and more nodes
switch to Bitcoin New over time.
+
[[fig1119]]
.Miners that run the soft fork signal support for it by increasing their block version.
image::{imagedir}/11-19.svg[{big-width}]

2. Wait until 750 of the last 1,000 blocks have a version of at
least 2.  When this threshold is reached, the New miners probably have
about 75% of the hashrate.

3. Start rejecting newly produced version 2 blocks that don’t contain
the height in the coinbase. These blocks are falsely signaling for
BIP34.

4. Wait until 950 of the last 1,000 blocks have version ≥2. When this
happens, the New miners have about 95% of the hashrate.

5. Start rejecting all new blocks with version 1. All miners producing
version 1 blocks will be losers because 95% of the hashrate rejects
those blocks. The hope is that miners that still haven’t upgraded will
do so quickly to avoid losing too much money on mining worthless
blocks.

****
image::{imagedir}/u11-04.svg[]
****

During step 1, nothing has changed. Only Bitcoin Old rules are in
effect. But when 750 of the last 1,000 blocks have version 2, we enter
the next step. Here, nodes running the soft fork start ensuring that
every new block of version 2 has the height in the coinbase. If not, the
block is dropped. One reason is that nodes might be deliberately or
accidentally using block version 2 for other purposes than this soft
fork. The 75% rule removes false positives before evaluating the 95%
rule.

From this point, some Old miner _could_ cause a chain split by
creating a block of version 2 that violates the “height in coinbase”
rule (<<fig1120>>).

[[fig1120]]
.The Old nodes could cause a chain split, but it probably won’t last for long.
image::{imagedir}/11-20.svg[{big-width}]

The Old miners would build on top of that block, whereas the New miners
would build on top of the previous block. But the New miners
_probably_—depending on the amount of “false” version 2 signaling—have
more hashrate and will outperform the Old miners and wipe out the
Bitcoin Old branch.

****
image::{imagedir}/u11-05.svg[]
****

When a greater portion of the blocks—95% of the last 1,000—signals
support with version 2 blocks, we enter the last step, step 5. From
this point forward, all blocks with versions < 2 will be dropped.

Why did we go through these stages? It isn’t entirely clear why the
75% rule was used, but it does remove false positives, as
described. The deployment might have worked fine with the 95% rule
only. We won’t explore the rationale behind the 75% rule—just accept
that it was used for this deployment and a few others. <<tab1102>>
lists soft forks that were introduced using this mechanism.

[[tab1102]]
.Features deployed an using incremented block version
|===
| BIP | Name | Date | Block version

| BIP34 | Block v2, Height in Coinbase | March 2013 | 2
| BIP66 | Strict DER Encoding | July 2015 | 3
| BIP65 | OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY | December 2015 | 4
|===

The upgrade mechanism just described is called a _miner-activated_ soft
fork. The miners start enforcing the new rules, and all or most full
nodes will follow because the New blocks are accepted by both Old and
New full nodes.

==== Using block version bits signaling—BIP9

[.inbitcoin]
.BIP9
****
This BIP specifies a standard for how to use the block header’s version
field to perform multiple simultaneous deployments.
****

Bitcoin’s developers collected a lot of experience from previous soft
forks. A few problems needed to be addressed:

* You can only deploy one soft fork at a time.

* Used block versions can’t be reused for new purposes.

The most annoying problem is that you can’t roll out multiple soft
forks at once. This is because previous deployment mechanisms, such as
the one used for BIP34, checked whether a block version was greater
than or equal to a certain number, for example, 2.

Suppose you wanted to deploy both BIP34 and BIP66
simultaneously. BIP34 would use block version 2, and BIP66 would use
block version 3. This would mean you couldn’t selectively signal
support for only BIP66; you’d also have to signal support for BIP34
because your block’s version 3 is greater than or equal to 2.

The developers came up with a bitcoin improvement proposal, BIP9, that
describes a process for how to deploy several soft forks
simultaneously.

This process also uses the block version, but in a different way. The
developers decided to change the way block version bytes are
interpreted. Block versions that have the top 3 bits set to exactly
`001` are treated differently.

First, all such block versions are greater than 4 because the smallest
such block version is `20000000`, which is a lot bigger than
`00000004`.  So, blocks using BIP9 will always support the
already-deployed BIP34, 66, and 65. Good.

Next, the 29 bits to the right of the leftmost `001` bits can be used
to signal support for at most 29 simultaneous soft forks. Each of the
29 rightmost version bits can be used to independently deploy a single
feature or group of features (<<fig1121>>). If a bit is set to `1`,
then the miner that produced the block supports the feature
represented by that bit number.

[[fig1121]]
.The block version is treated differently. Each of the right 29 bits can signal for different proposals.
image::{imagedir}/11-21.svg[{full-width}]

Several parameters need to be defined for each deployable feature:

* _Name_—A short but descriptive name for the feature

* _Bit_—The number of the bit to use for signaling

* _Start time_—What time to start monitoring for miner support

* _Timeout_—A time when the deployment will be considered failed

The deployment goes through a number of _states_ (see <<fig1122>>). The
state is updated _after each retarget period_.

* `DEFINED`—The starting state. It means a retarget hasn’t yet happened
after the start time.

* `STARTED`—Wait until at least 1,916 (95%) blocks in the last retarget
period signal support.

* `LOCKED_IN`—A grace period to give the remaining nonsignaling miners a
chance to upgrade. If they don’t, their blocks might be rejected.

[.gbinfo]
.Comparing times
****
When comparing block times to the start time and timeout, we always
use median time past, as described in <<timestamp-rules>>.
****

* `ACTIVE`—The new rules are in effect.

* `FAILED`—The timeout occurred before the deployment got `LOCKED_IN`. If
conditions happen simultaneously, timeout has precedence over other
conditions, such as the 95% rule.

[[fig1122]]
.State transitions happen every 2,016 blocks.
image::{imagedir}/11-22.svg[{full-width}]

When the deployment is `ACTIVE` or `FAILED`, the bit used to signal
support should be reset to `0` so that it can then be reused for other
deployments.

==== Using BIP9 to deploy relative lock time

[.inbitcoin]
.BIPs 68, 112, and 113
****
This “feature” is actually a group of BIPs that collectively make the
relative lock time work.
****

Let’s look at an example of how a deployment using version bits can play
out. We’ll look at how relative lock time was deployed. The developers
of this new feature defined the following BIP9 parameters:

----
name:       csv
bit:        0
start time: 2016-05-01 00:00:00
timeout:    2017-05-01 00:00:00
----

The timeout was one year after the start time, which gave the miners
about one year to upgrade to the soft fork implementing this feature.

<<fig1123>> shows the state transitions that occurred.

[[fig1123]]
.BIP9 deployment of `csv`. It went well.
image::{imagedir}/11-23.svg[{full-width}]

This deployment went quickly and smoothly. It took only three retarget
periods for 95% of the miners to upgrade to the new software.

Unfortunately, all deployments aren’t as smooth.


/////
let's look at it in a bit finer detail:

.States of the BIP9 deployment of relative lock time.
[%autowidth,role="widetable"]
|===
| State | Date (median time past) | Block height | Why?

| *DEFINED* | 2009-01-03 18:15 | 0    	  | All features are, by definition in BIP9, DEFINED since block 0
| ...     | ...              | ... | ...
| DEFINED | 2016-05-01 00:11 | 409643   | Median past time has passed start time, but retarget period need to finish

==== Using BIP9 to deploy segwit

****
image::{imagedir}/u11-06.svg[]
****

Segwit, described in <<ch10>>, also used BIP9 for its deployment, but
things didn’t work out as anticipated. It started out the same way
`csv` deployment did. The parameters selected for this deployment were
as follows:

----
name:       segwit
bit:        1
start time: 2016-11-15 00:00:00
timeout:    2017-11-15 00:00:00
----

A new version of Bitcoin Core was released with these segwit
deployment parameters. Users adopted this new version pretty quickly,
but for some reason, miners seemed hesitant. The signaling plateaued
at around 30%, and the deployment process got stuck in the `STARTED`
state, as <<fig1124>> shows.

[[fig1124]]
.The segwit deployment didn’t proceed as anticipated.
image::{imagedir}/11-24.svg[{full-width}]

The segwit deployment was at risk of failing—entering the `FAILED` state
after timeout. If this happens, a whole new deployment cycle must be put
in place and executed, which could take another year.

===== Conflicts of interest

****
image::{imagedir}/u11-07.svg[]
****

Another proposal was discussed in parallel. This proposal was known as
_Segwit2x_. It was a proposal to first activate segwit _and then_
increase the maximum block weight via a hard fork, in addition to the
maximum block size increase segwit itself provides. This proposal would
use BIP9 with version bit 4 to signal support. Bitcoin Core didn’t show
any interest in this proposal, but the Bitcoin Core software repository
was copied under the name btc1 by a group of people who used it to
implement the proposal. The threshold would be 80% of the last 2,016
blocks to lock in segwit. This proposal got a lot of traction among
miners.

A discrepancy seemed to exist between what full nodes wanted and what
miners wanted. Rumors and theories floated around about what caused this
discrepancy. We won’t go into that here, but will stick to what we know.

===== A user-activated soft fork

****
image::{imagedir}/u11-08.svg[]
****

In the midst of all this, another proposal, BIP148, surfaced that
would start dropping blocks that didn’t signal bit 1 (segwit) on 1
August 2017. The effect would be that nodes running BIP148 would
experience a 100% adoption of BIP141, which would cause BIP141 to lock
in after at most two retargets. This is what’s known as a
_user-activated soft fork_. Users—those running full
nodes—collectively decide that they’ll start applying new rules, and
if miners don’t comply, their blocks will be discarded. We’ll talk a
bit more about user-activated soft forks toward the end of this
chapter.

BIP148 was an attempt at forcing segwit deployment despite hesitant
miners.

Some groups, especially the Bitcoin Core team, thought this proposal
was too risky. It would cause a chain split if a miner published a
non-segwit-signalling block. But there was also a group of people
wanting to move forward with BIP148 regardless. This caused some worry
in the Bitcoin community.

===== A proposal to bridge the groups

****
image::{imagedir}/u11-09.svg[]
****

We had a stalled segwit deployment, an alternate segwit2x fork coming
that many miners seemed to want, and a group of impatient users wanting
to enforce segwit using BIP148.

To avoid a timeout of the segwit deployment—which would further delay
segwit—and to avoid a possible blockchain split by BIP148, and to please
the segwit2x crowd, a new BIP was written. BIP91 would satisfy all of
these groups. It would use BIP9 with a custom threshold:

----
name:       segsignal
bit:        4
start time: 2017-06-01 00:00:00
timeout:    2017-11-15 00:00:00
Period:     336 blocks
Threshold:  269 blocks (80%)
Ceases to be active when segwit (bit 1) is LOCKED_IN or FAILED.
----

This BIP did things a bit differently than normal BIP9 deployments. It
used a shorter period—336 blocks instead of 2,016 blocks—and a lower
threshold—80% instead of 95%.

While active, this BIP behaved like BIP148. All blocks that didn’t
signal bit 1 (segwit) were rejected. Note how this was compatible with
both BIP148 and segwit2x. It signaled using bit 4, the same bit segwit2x
would use, and it enforced segwit lock-in by rejecting
non-bit-1-signaling blocks.

This BIP wasn’t implemented in Bitcoin Core, but in a copied version of
Bitcoin Core. This version quickly got broad adoption among miners, and
on 21 July 2017, the BIP got `LOCKED_IN`. See <<fig1125>>.

[[fig1125]]
.BIP91 updates its state every 336 blocks instead of the usual 2,016. This went quickly.
image::{imagedir}/11-25.svg[{full-width}]

It activated three days after `LOCKED_IN`. Note that it was mainly
miners that adopted BIP91. Normal users typically used Bitcoin Core,
which didn’t implement BIP91.

When miners activated BIP91, they started dropping blocks that didn’t
signal bit 1, which is the bit for the `segwit` deployment. The result
was that non-bit-1 blocks didn’t make it into the strongest chain, which
quickly forced the remaining miners to upgrade to segwit to avoid mining
invalid blocks.

Miners were starting to signal segwit, the original segwit proposal
using bit 1 for its deployment, and it got `LOCKED_IN` on 9 August 2017
and became `ACTIVE` on 24 August 2017, as <<fig1126>> shows.

[[fig1126]]
.Segwit finally activates thanks to BIP91.
image::{imagedir}/11-26.svg[{full-width}]

Normal nonmining users, merchants, and exchanges didn’t have to do
anything in particular to stay on the strongest chain because their
software (normal segwit-enabled software) follows the strongest valid
chain. This meant BIP141 got `LOCKED_IN` and then `ACTIVE` for all users
and miners at the same time.

===== Lessons learned

The events that occurred during segwit deployment weren’t anticipated.
Few people thought that miners would refuse to adopt BIP141. Yet that’s
what happened.

It became clear that BIP9 isn’t an ideal way to deploy a soft fork. It
gives 5% of the hashrate a veto against it. Given that several miners
each control more than 5% of the total hashrate, any one of those
individual entities can block a system upgrade.

[.important]

As noted in <<trust-in-lisa>>, we pay miners to perform correct,
honest transaction confirmations. We don’t pay them to _decide_ the
rules, we pay them to _follow_ the rules. The rules are decided
collectively by everyone, you and me, by running our Bitcoin software
of choice.

Think about that.

==== User-activated soft forks

To underscore the importance of the economic majority (you, me, and
everyone else using Bitcoin), and to avoid having miners vetoing
proposals that the economic majority wants, people started thinking more
about user-activated soft forks.

Let’s look at a fictitious example of a user-activated soft fork.

Suppose 99% of Bitcoin users (end users, exchanges, merchants, and so
on) want a rule change—for example, smaller blocks—that would be a soft
fork. Also suppose no miner wants smaller blocks, so they all refuse to
comply. Assume also that 99% of the nonmining full nodes change their
software to reject all big blocks after a certain block height.

What will happen when that block height passes? Miners that produce big
blocks will build a blockchain that users will deem invalid (<<fig1127>>).

[[fig1127]]
.Users start rejecting big blocks. They see no new valid blocks, but plenty of invalid (too-big) blocks.
image::{imagedir}/11-27.svg[{half-width}]

The value of the block rewards in the “miner” chain will be unknown
because the exchanges don’t deal with the miner chain. Miners won’t be
able to exchange their block rewards to pay their electricity bills.
Even if the electricity provider takes Bitcoin, the miners won’t be able
to pay with their block rewards because the electricity provider won’t
accept the miner’s blocks as valid. The electricity provider is also a
Bitcoin user, remember?

But if a single miner decides to comply with users’ demands, the blocks
that miner produces will be the only blocks users actually accept
(<<fig1128>>).

[[fig1128]]
.One miner decides to go with the users’ will and only build small blocks. This miner will be able to pay the bills.
image::{imagedir}/11-28.svg[{big-width}]

This single miner will be rewarded for the block it created because the
economic majority accepts the block. The blocks on the miner (big-block)
chain are still pretty worthless because no users accept them. On top of
this, the single small-block miner will be able to charge more fees than
before because the total amount of block space is smaller—both because
the maximum block weight is smaller and because the total number of
blocks is smaller.

Some more big-block miners will probably realize they’re quickly
running out of money and decide to switch to the user-accepted branch
(<<fig1129>>).

[[fig1129]]
.A few more miners realize it’s more profitable to work on the users’ branch.
image::{imagedir}/11-29.svg[{full-width}]

When more miners move over to the users’ branch, that branch will
eventually grow stronger than the big-blocks branch. When this
happens, the big-blocks branch will get wiped out (<<fig1130>>), and
the remaining miners will automatically switch to the small-blocks
branch because the change is a soft fork.

[[fig1130]]
.The users’ branch is stronger and wipes out the big-blocks branch.
image::{imagedir}/11-30.svg[{full-width}]

Users win.

One of the first soft forks in Bitcoin, the deployment of BIP16 (p2sh),
was a user-activated soft fork. The deployment was manual in the sense
that developers, on a specific day, manually counted the number of
blocks that signaled support and then decided on a flag day that they
put in the next release of the Bitcoin software. After this date, all
blocks that didn’t comply with the new rules were rejected by nodes
running this software.

To use the insights from the recent segwit deployment, a new deployment
mechanism is in the making as of this writing. It’s generally called a
user-activated soft fork. The idea is to start with a BIP9-like
deployment, but with the exception that if the deployment doesn’t get
`LOCKED_IN` well before the timeout, blocks that don’t signal for the
fork will be dropped. This will effectively cause 100% support because
noncompliant blocks won’t count anymore, and the deployment will soon
get `LOCKED_IN`.

=== Recap

This chapter has taught you about hard forks and soft forks, and how to
deploy soft forks without splitting the blockchain. We’ve talked about
several miner-activated soft forks and a few user-activated soft forks.

We can illustrate hard forks and soft forks as shown here.

image::{imagedir}/u11-10.svg[{big-width}]

In a _hard fork,_ the rules are _relaxed_ so that a New block might be
invalid according to Old rules. In the event of a blockchain split, the
New branch might get wiped out by the Old branch.

In a _soft fork_, the rules are _tightened_. Old blocks might be
invalid according to New rules. In case of a blockchain split, the Old
branch risks a wipeout.

You can protect a hard fork against a wipeout by deliberately making the
New branch incompatible with the Old branch. For example, Bitcoin Cash
requires the first block after the split to have a base size > 1,000,000
bytes, which is invalid according to the Old rules. You can’t protect
the Old branch in a soft fork from wipeout.

To roll out a soft fork, care must be taken not to split the blockchain.
If a split happens, and both branches remain active over a significant
amount of time, it will cause a lot of pain for users, exchanges,
miners, and so on.

In a _miner-activated soft fork_, miners signal their support; when,
for example, 95% of the blocks signal support, the new rules start being
enforced after a grace period. BIP9 standardized this process.

image::{imagedir}/u11-11.svg[{full-width}]

In a _user-activated soft fork_, users start enforcing the rules on a
specific day (or block height). A standard for this is being developed
as of this writing, and it will probably be a hybrid of BIP9 and
user-activated soft fork.

image::{imagedir}/u11-12.svg[{full-width}]

The difference from a pure BIP9 deployment is that the user-activated
soft fork process is guaranteed to proceed to `ACTIVE` once the node has
entered the `STARTED` state. In the `STARTED` state, miners have a
chance to move the deployment to a `LOCKED_IN` state; but if they don’t,
and the timeout has passed, then the supporting full nodes (including
miners that support the upgrade) will start enforcing the rules anyway.

A user-activated soft fork was used to deploy BIP16, p2sh, but it was
done manually. Other than this, the community has no real-world
experience with user-activated soft forks.

=== Exercises

==== Warm up

. A soft fork is a change of the consensus rules, but what
characterizes the changes made in a soft fork?

. Suppose a hard fork causes a blockchain split, and the New branch
has 51% of the hashrate. Furthermore, suppose the hashrate on the New
branch drops to about 45%.

.. What event will eventually happen?

.. Why did I say that the event will _eventually_ happen? When does
the event occur?

.. What can the developers of Bitcoin New do to prevent the event from
happening?

. Suppose an Old node causes a blockchain split due to a soft fork in
which 80% of the hashrate runs Bitcoin New. Will the Old branch of the
split last long? Explain your answer.

. Suppose you try to deploy a soft fork using BIP9. Your deployment
has just reached the `LOCKED_IN` state. How long do you have to wait
before your rules start being enforced?

==== Dig in

[start=5]
. Suppose a fork changes the consensus rules such that Old nodes
can create blocks invalid to New nodes, and New nodes can create blocks
invalid to Old nodes.
+
image::{imagedir}/u11-13.svg[{half-width}]
+
What nodes (New, Old, both, or none), would be able to cause a
blockchain split when this fork is deployed?

. Why is it desirable to have a reassuring majority of the hashrate
supporting Bitcoin New in a soft fork before starting to enforce the
New rules?

. Suppose a hard fork has caused a permanent blockchain split and
you’re about to make a payment using Bitcoin New. Why is replay
protection desirable in this scenario?

. Suppose you want to deploy a soft fork using BIP9 with the
following parameters:
+
----
bit:        12
start time: 2027-01-01 00:00:00
timeout:    2028-01-01 00:00:00
----
+
Also assume that the deployment is in `STARTED` state, all 2016 blocks
in the current retarget period have been mined, and all of them signal
support using bit 12. The last (2016th) block, B~1~, in the current
retarget period has the following properties:
+
[subs="normal"]
----
timestamp T~1~:          2027-12-31 23:59:59
median time past MTP~1~: 2027-12-31 23:59:58
----
+
Will this deployment eventually get to the `ACTIVE` state?

. Suppose you want to make a user-activated soft fork. You find
it hard to convince other users to install your software. What would
happen on the flag day if just a small percentage (<30%) of the economy
chose to run your software?

. Suppose you want to make a user-activated soft fork. Lots of
other users seem to like your soft fork. Say that 80% of the economy
installs your fork. Why would miners (even those that don’t like your
change) probably switch to the New rules during this user-activated soft
fork?

. In the previous exercise, your soft fork had support from 80%
of the economy. Suppose also that a majority of the hashrate decides to
follow your New rules. What happens with the nonmining nodes that don’t
run your fork?

=== Summary

* You don’t want a blockchain split when deploying a fork because this
would cause disruption in the Bitcoin economy.

* A hard fork is a consensus rule change that requires every miner to
upgrade. Otherwise, the blockchain will split.

* A soft fork is a consensus rule change that doesn’t require
simultaneous upgrade of the entire network.

* During a blockchain split due to a hard fork, you want wipeout
protection to make sure the New branch isn’t reorged by Old nodes.

* In a blockchain split, you want replay protection to let you select
what branch your transactions are applied to.

* A miner-activated soft fork—for example, one using BIP9 for
deployment—lets miners deploy a noncontroversial soft fork.

* A user-activated soft fork lets users enforce a soft fork
deployment. If a hashrate majority eventually follows, the soft fork
succeeds without a lasting blockchain split.
