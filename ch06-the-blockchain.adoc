This chapter covers

* Improving spreadsheet security
* Lightweight (SPV) wallets
* Reducing wallet bandwidth requirements

In <<ch05>>, we discussed transactions that let anyone verify all
transactions in the spreadsheet. But there are still things verifiers
can’t verify—that Lisa doesn’t remove or censor transactions. We’ll
handle censorship resistance in chapters 7 and 8. This chapter examines
how to make it impossible for Lisa to remove or replace transactions
without also making it obvious that she’s tampered with the transaction
history.

Lisa does this by replacing the spreadsheet with a _blockchain_
(<<fig0601>>). The blockchain contains transactions that are secured
from tampering through hashing and signing the set of transactions in
a clever way. This technique makes it easy to provide cryptographic
proof of fraud if Lisa deletes or replaces transactions. All verifiers
keep their own copies of the blockchain, and they can fully verify it
to ensure that Lisa doesn’t remove already-confirmed transactions.

This chapter also introduces a lightweight wallet, or _simplified
payment verification_ (SPV) wallet, that will defer blockchain
verification to someone else—a full node—to save bandwidth and storage
space. This is possible thanks to the blockchain, but it comes at a
cost.

=== Lisa can delete transactions

As noted several times before, Lisa can delete transactions. For
example, Lisa could buy a cookie from the cafe, eat it, and delete the
transaction. Of course, she wouldn’t do this because she’s the most
trustworthy person on earth, but not all her coworkers know or believe
this. Suppose she does indeed delete a transaction, as <<fig0602>> shows.

[[fig0602]]
.Lisa buys a cookie and then reverts the transaction. She just stole a cookie from the cafe! The cafe and Lisa now have different UTXO sets.
image::{imagedir}/06-02.svg[{big-width}]

Later, when the cafe notices that the transaction has disappeared, it
can’t prove that Lisa’s transaction was ever in the spreadsheet. And
Lisa can’t prove it wasn’t there. This situation is troublesome. If it’s
word against word, you’re in for a long and costly dispute, possibly
involving lawyers, police, Acme Insurances, and private detectives.

How can you prove whether a transaction was confirmed? Lisa needs a way
to publish transactions and their ordering such that she can’t tamper
with them.

=== Building the blockchain

Lisa can delete transactions because no one can prove that the list of
all transactions has changed. What if we could change the system to make
it provable that she’s fiddled with history?

Among your coworkers, some developers suggest getting rid of the cookie
token spreadsheet and replacing it with a blockchain (<<fig0603>>).

[[fig0603]]
.A blockchain is a chain of blocks. These blocks contain transactions, and each block references its predecessor.
image::{imagedir}/06-03.svg[{big-width}]

[.inbitcoin]
.Blockchain length
****
[.movingtarget]

The Bitcoin blockchain contains hundreds of thousands of blocks. At the
time of writing, the chain tip had height 550,836.
****

In the blockchain, each block references the previous block and has an
implicit _height_ that says how far it is from the first block. The
first block has height 0, the second block has height 1, and so on. In
<<fig0603>>, the _chain tip_, or last block, of this blockchain is
at height 7, meaning the blockchain is 8 blocks long. Every 10
minutes, Lisa puts recent unconfirmed transactions into a new block
and makes it available to everybody who’s interested.

The blockchain stores transactions just like the spreadsheet did. But
each block also contains a _block header_ to protect the integrity of
the contained transactions and the blockchain before it. Let’s say the
blockchain in <<fig0603>> has grown to contain 20 blocks, so the chain
tip is at height 19. <<fig0604>> zooms in on the last few blocks of the
blockchain.

[[fig0604]]
.Each block header protects the integrity of the contained transactions and the blockchain before the block.
image::{imagedir}/06-04.svg[{full-width}]

[.bigside]
.Block header
****
image::{imagedir}/u06-01.svg[]
****

Each block contains one or more transactions and a block header. The
block header consists of

* The double SHA256 hash of the previous block’s header

* The combined hash of the transactions in the block, the _merkle root_

* A timestamp of the block’s creation time

* Lisa’s signature of the block header

[.bigside]
****
image::{imagedir}/u06-02.svg[]
****

The hash of a block header is an identifier for the block, just as a
transaction hash, or transaction ID (txid), is an identifier for a
transaction. I’ll sometimes refer to the block header hash as the
_block ID_.

The leftmost part of the block header is the block ID of the previous
block in the blockchain. This is why it’s called a block_chain_. The
previous block-header hashes form a chain of block headers.

The second part from the left is the combined hash of the
transactions.  This is the _merkle root_ of a _merkle tree_. We’ll
talk about this in later sections of this chapter, but for now, let’s
just say that the transactions in the block are hashed together into a
single hash value that’s written into the block header. You can’t
change any transactions in the block without also changing the merkle
root.

The third part from the left is the block’s creation time. This time
isn’t exact and doesn’t even always increase from block to block. But
it’s roughly accurate.

The fourth part is Lisa’s block signature, which is a stamp of
approval from Lisa that anyone can verify. Lisa’s signature proves
that she once approved the block, which can be held against her if she
tries to cheat.  You’ll see how this works shortly. The digital
signature in the block header introduces some problems, which we’ll
fix in <<ch07>> by replacing these digital signatures with something
called _proof of work_.

==== Lisa builds a block

[.inbitcoin]
.Shared folder? Really?
****
Bitcoin doesn’t use a shared folder. The shared folder is a
placeholder for Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer network, which we’ll look at in
<<ch08>>.
****

Lisa creates a new block roughly every 10 minutes, containing
unconfirmed transactions. She writes this block into a new file in a
shared folder. Everyone has permission to create new files in the
shared folder, but no one has permission to delete or change
files. When Lisa writes a block to a file in the shared folder, she
_confirms_ the transactions in that block.

Suppose Lisa is about to create a new block at height 20. She’ll do the
following:

1. Create a block template.
2. Sign the block template to make it complete.
3. Publish the block.

===== Block templates

Lisa starts by creating the _block template_, a block without a
signature (<<fig0605>>).

[[fig0605]]
.Lisa creates a new block. It’s called a _block template_ because it isn’t yet signed.
image::{imagedir}/06-05.svg[{full-width}]

She collects several transactions to put in the block. She then creates
the block header. She creates the previous block ID by hashing the
previous block header and putting the result in the new block header.
The merkle root is built using the transactions in the block template,
and the time is set to the current time.

[.inbitcoin]
.Block rewards
****
In Bitcoin, the block reward covers more than just the newly created
money. It also includes transaction fees, discussed in <<ch07>>. The
newly created money in a block is called the _block subsidy_.
****

The first transaction in her block is a coinbase transaction. Blocks’
coinbase transactions create 50 CT per block instead of 7,200 CT as
was the case in <<ch05>>. The idea is that Lisa produces a new block
every 10 minutes, which means her daily 7,200 CT reward is spread out
over 144 blocks: there are 144 blocks in 24 hours, and 144*50 CT =
7,200 CT.  We’ll talk more about block rewards and the coinbase in
<<ch07>>.

===== Signing the block

Before Lisa is finished with the block, she must sign it using a private
key only she knows, as shown in <<fig0606>>.

[[fig0606]]
.Lisa signs a block with her block-signing private key. The public key is well known among the coworkers.
image::{imagedir}/06-06.svg[{half-width}]

[.inbitcoin]
.Proof of work
****
Bitcoin blocks aren’t signed this way. They’re “signed” with proof of
work, described in <<ch07>>.
****

Lisa uses her private block-signing key to sign the block header. This
digital signature commits to

* The previous block ID, which means Lisa’s signature commits to the
entire blockchain before this new block

* The merkle root, which means the signature commits to all
transactions in this new block

* The timestamp

If anything in the blockchain before the new block or in the
transactions in this block changes, the block header’s contents will
have to change, too; consequently, the signature will become invalid.

****
image::{imagedir}/u06-03.svg[]
****

The public key corresponding to Lisa’s block-signing key must be made
publicly available to all verifiers. The company can publish the public
key on its intranet and on a bulletin board at the main entrance. The
signature is required because only Lisa should be able to add blocks to
the blockchain (for now). For example, John, can create a block and
write it to the shared folder. But he won’t be able to sign it correctly
because he doesn’t have Lisa’s private key, so no one will accept John’s
block.

Using private keys to sign blocks can be a bad idea for two reasons:

* Lisa’s private key can be stolen. If this happens, the thief can create
valid blocks and write them to the shared folder. These blocks’ coinbase
transactions will of course pay the block rewards to the thief’s PKH,
and not to Lisa’s.

* The sources containing Lisa’s public key—for example, the bulletin board
and the intranet—might be compromised and the public keys replaced by
some bad guy’s public key. If this happens, some verifiers will be
tricked into accepting blocks signed by a key other than Lisa’s
block-signing key. The bad guy can fool some portion of the verifiers. A
coworker shouldn’t trust just the note on the bulletin board, because
it’s easy for someone to replace the note with a false public key.
Coworkers need to get the public key from different sources, such as the
bulletin board, the intranet, and by asking fellow workers. A single
source is too easily manipulated by bad guys.

The way blocks are signed will change in <<ch07>>, from digital
signatures to proof of work.

===== Publishing the block

Once the block is signed, Lisa needs to make it available to verifiers.
She uses the shared folder for this, creating a new file, block_20.dat,
in which to save her new block (<<fig0607>>).

[[fig0607]]
.Lisa has signed her new block and saves it into a new file in the shared folder.
image::{imagedir}/06-07.svg[{big-width}]

The block is now published. Anyone interested can read this block from
the shared folder. Remember that no one can delete or alter this file
due to restrictive permissions on the shared folder. Not even Lisa can
change it. There is, however, a system administrator who has full
permission to do anything with the shared folder. We’ll get rid of the
system administrator in <<ch08>>, when I introduce the peer-to-peer
network.

[[transaction-selection]]
===== Transaction selection

When Lisa builds her block, she picks transactions to include. She can
select anything from zero transactions to all unconfirmed transactions.
The transaction order isn’t important as long as all transactions spend
outputs already present in the blockchain or in the block being built.
For example, the block in <<fig0608>> is perfectly fine.

[[fig0608]]
.Transactions must be ordered in _spending order_. Otherwise, there are no restrictions.
image::{imagedir}/06-08.svg[{half-width}]

All transactions in this block spend transactions already in the
blockchain, meaning they all reference transactions to the left of
themselves. But the block in <<fig0609>> is invalid.

[[fig0609]]
.This block is invalid because a transaction spends an output that doesn’t yet exist.
image::{imagedir}/06-09.svg[{half-width}]

It’s invalid because a transaction spends an output that’s placed
_after_—to the right of—the spending transaction.

==== How does this protect us from deletes?

Suppose Lisa wants to eat a cookie without paying for it. She creates a
transaction and puts it in the block she’s currently working on, block
height 21. She creates the block header, signs it, and writes the block
to a new file (block_21.dat) in the shared folder (<<fig0610>>).

[[fig0610]]
.Lisa creates a block containing her payment for a cookie.
image::{imagedir}/06-10.svg[{full-width}]

The cafe watches the shared folder for incoming blocks. When Lisa writes
the block file into the shared folder, the cafe downloads the block and
verifies it. Verifying a block involves verifying the following:

* The block-header signature is valid. The signature is verified using
Lisa’s public key obtained from the bulletin board or intranet.

* The previous block ID exists. It’s block 20 in this case.

* All transactions in the block are valid. This uses the same verification
approach as in <<ch05>>, using a private unspent transaction output
(UTXO) set.

* The combined hash of all transactions matches the merkle root in the
block header.

* The timestamp is within reasonable limits.

Lisa has paid for a cookie, and the cafe has downloaded the block that
contains Lisa’s transaction and verified it. The cafe gives Lisa the
cookie, and she eats it.

Can Lisa undo this payment without being proven a fraud? Her only
option is to make another, changed version of block 21 that doesn’t
include her transaction and to write this new block to the shared
folder as block_21b.dat (<<fig0611>>).

[[fig0611]]
.Lisa creates an alternative block at height 21 that doesn’t contain her transaction.
image::{imagedir}/06-11.svg[{big-width}]

The new version is like the old version but without Lisa’s transaction.
Because she tampers with the transactions in the block, she has to
update the merkle root in the header with a merkle root that matches the
new set of transactions in the block. When she changes the header, the
signature is no longer valid, and the header needs to be re-signed. To
make the changed block available to verifiers, she needs to put the
block on the shared folder, for example using filename block_21b.dat.

The cafe has already downloaded the first version of block 21. When Lisa
adds the new block file, the cafe will discover that there’s another
version of the block in the shared folder (<<fig0612>>).

[[fig0612]]
.The cafe sees two versions of block 21, one with Lisa’s transaction and one without.
image::{imagedir}/06-12.svg[{big-width}]

Now the cafe sees two different blocks at height 21, one that contains
the 10 CT payment to the cafe and one that doesn’t. Both blocks are
equally valid, and neither block is more accurate than the other from
a verification perspective. But the good thing is that the cafe can
prove Lisa is playing dirty tricks because she’s created two different
_signed_ versions of the block. The signatures prove Lisa cheated, and
you no longer have a word-against-word situation. Lisa will be fired
or at least removed from her powerful position as a transaction
processor.

What if there were other blocks after block 21 when Lisa cheated?
Suppose blocks 22 and 23 were already created when Lisa decided she
wanted to delete her transaction (<<fig0613>>).

[[fig0613]]
.Lisa needs to create alternative versions of the block containing her transaction and all subsequent blocks.
image::{imagedir}/06-13.svg[{full-width}]

[.bigside]
****
image::{imagedir}/u06-04.svg[]
****

Now she needs to make three alternative blocks: 21, 22, and 23. They
must all be replaced by valid blocks.

[role="important"]
Changing anything in a block makes that block and all subsequent
blocks invalid. This is because each block header contains a pointer
to the previous block—the previous block ID—which will become invalid
if the previous block changes.

==== Why use a blockchain?

The blockchain is a complicated way to sign a bunch of transactions.
Wouldn’t it be much simpler if Lisa just signed all transactions ever
made in one big chunk every 10 minutes? This would accomplish the same
goal. But this approach has several problems:

* As the number of transactions grows, the time it takes for Lisa to
sign the entire set will increase.

* The same goes for verifiers—the time it takes to verify a signature
increases with the total number of transactions.

* It’s hard for verifiers to know what’s new since the last signature.
This information is valuable when maintaining the UTXO set.

By using the blockchain, Lisa has to sign only the most recent block of
transactions while still, indirectly via the previous block ID pointer,
signing all historic transactions, as <<fig0614>> shows.

[[fig0614]]
.Each block signs all transactions ever made, thanks to the headers’ previous block ID field.
image::{imagedir}/06-14.svg[{full-width}]

Each block’s signature reinforces the previous blocks’
signatures. This will become important when we replace the signatures
with proof of work in the next chapter.

The verifiers can also easily see what’s new since the last block and
update their UTXO sets accordingly. The new transactions are right
there in the block.

The blockchain also provides some nice extra features that we’ll
discuss later, such as the merkle tree.

[[lightweight-wallets]]
=== Lightweight wallets

Coworkers who want to verify the blockchain to make sure they have
valid financial information use software that downloads the entire
blockchain and keeps a UTXO set up to date at all times. This software
needs to run nearly all the time to stay up to date with newly
produced blocks. We call this running software a _full node_. A full
node knows about all transactions since block 0, the _genesis
block_. The company and the cafe are typical full-node users. They
don’t have to trust someone else with providing them with financial
information: they get their information directly from the
blockchain. Anyone is free to run this software as they please.

[.gbinfo]
.Alternative names
****
A lightweight wallet is sometimes referred to as an _SPV client_ or an
_SPV wallet_. SPV stands for _simplified payment verification_.
****

In <<ch04>>, I introduced a mobile app that coworkers can use to
manage their private keys, as well as send and receive money. This
wallet app has now been adapted to the new blockchain system.

Because most wallet users are on a mobile data plan, they don’t want
to waste bandwidth on downloading all—for them, uninteresting—block
data.  The overwhelming majority of the blocks won’t contain any
transactions concerning them, so downloading all that data would only
make their phones run out of data traffic without providing useful
information.

The full-node developers and the wallet developers cooperate to let
wallets connect to full nodes over the internet and get relevant block
data from those nodes in a way that doesn’t require huge amounts of
data traffic. Wallets are allowed to connect to any full node and ask
for the data they need.

Suppose John’s wallet contains two addresses, @~a~ and @~b~, and he
wants to receive notifications from a full node about transactions
concerning his wallet. He can make a network connection to any of the
full nodes—for example, the cafe’s. The wallet and the full node then
start talking, as <<fig0615>> shows.

[[fig0615]]
.Information exchange between a lightweight wallet and a full node. The full node sends all block headers and a fraction of all transactions to the wallet.
image::{imagedir}/06-15.svg[{big-width}]

We’ll examine how this connection is made and how the wallet and node
send information between each other more thoroughly in <<ch08>>. I
only provide a high-level glimpse here, as follows:

[.inbitcoin]
.BIP37
****
This process is described in full detail in BIP37, found at <<web-bips>>.
****

1. John’s wallet asks the full node for all block headers since the
wallet’s last known block header and all transactions concerning John’s
addresses.

2. The cafe’s full node sends all requested block headers to the wallet
and at least all transactions concerning John’s addresses.

In step 1, the wallet doesn’t send the exact list of addresses in John’s
wallet. This would harm John’s privacy because the cafe would then know
that all John’s addresses belong together and could sell that
information to Acme Insurances. Not nice. John’s wallet instead sends a
filter to the full node. This filter is called a _bloom filter_. The
full node uses it to determine whether to send a transaction to the
wallet. The filter tells the full node to send all transactions
concerning @~a~ and @~b~, but it also tells the full node to send
transactions that aren’t relevant to John’s wallet, to obfuscate what
addresses actually belong to the wallet. Although bloom filters don’t
have much to do with the blockchain, I still dedicate a subsection to
them here because lightweight wallets use them extensively.

In step 2, transactions and block headers are sent to John’s wallet, but
the complete blocks aren’t sent (to save network traffic). John’s wallet
can’t use just a transaction and the header to verify that the
transaction is in the block. Something more is required: a _partial
merkle tree_ that proves that one or more transactions are included in
the block.

The two steps are performed as a synchronizing phase just after the
wallet connects to the cafe’s full node. After this, as Lisa creates
new blocks and the cafe’s full node picks them up, the corresponding
block headers are sent to the wallet together with all transactions
concerning John’s addresses in roughly the same way as described
earlier.

We’ll next discuss bloom filters. Merkle trees are explained in
<<merkle-trees>>.

[[bloom-filters-obfuscate-addresses]]
==== Bloom filters obfuscate addresses

John’s wallet contains two addresses, @~a~ and @~b~, but John doesn’t
want to reveal to anyone that @~a~ and @~b~ belong to the same wallet.
He has reason to be wary because he’s heard rumors that Acme
Insurances pays good money for such information, to “adjust” premiums
based on people’s cookie-eating habits.

===== Creating the bloom filter

To obfuscate what addresses belong together, John’s wallet creates a
bloom filter to send to the full node (<<fig0616>>).

[[fig0616]]
.The client sends a bloom filter to the full node to obfuscate what addresses belong to the wallet.
image::{imagedir}/06-16.svg[{big-width}]

The bloom filter is a sequence of bits, which, as mentioned in
<<ch02>>, can have the value 0 or the value 1. John’s bloom filter
happens to be 8 bits long. <<fig0617>> illustrates how it was created.

[[fig0617]]
.The lightweight wallet creates a bloom filter to send to the full node. Each address in the wallet is added to the bloom filter.
image::{imagedir}/06-17.svg[{full-width}]

The wallet creates the sequence of bits (the bloom filter) and
initializes them with zeroes all over. It then adds all John’s public
key hashes (PKHs) to the bloom filter, starting with PKH~a~, the PKH
for @~a~.

[.inbitcoin]
.Why three hash functions?
****
The number of hash functions can be anything, as can the size of the
bloom filter. This example uses three hash functions and 8 bits.
****

It runs PKH~a~ through the first of the three hash functions. This
hash function results in the value `2`. This value is the index of a
bit in the bloom filter. The bit at index 2 (the third from the left)
is then set to `1`. Then PKH~a~ is run through the second hash
function, which outputs `0`, and the corresponding bit (the first
from the left in the figure) is set to `1`. Finally, the third hash
function outputs `6`, and the bit at index 6 (seventh from the left)
is set to `1`.

Next up is PKH~b~, which is handled the exact same way. The three hash
functions output `5`, `0`, and `3`. These three bits are all set to
`1`.  Note that bit 0 was already set by PKH~a~, so this bit isn’t
modified.

The bloom filter is finished and ready to be sent to the full node.

===== Use the bloom filter

The full node receives the bloom filter from the wallet and wants to
use it to filter transactions to send to the wallet.

Suppose Lisa just published a new block to the shared folder, and the
full node has verified the block. The full node now wants to send the
new block’s header and all relevant transactions in it to the wallet.
How does the full node use the bloom filter to determine what
transactions to send?

The block contains three transactions: Tx~1~, Tx~2~, and Tx~3~ (<<fig0618>>).

[[fig0618]]
.The block to send contains three transactions; only one concerns John.
image::{imagedir}/06-18.svg[{full-width}]

Tx~1~ and Tx~3~ have nothing to do with John’s addresses, but Tx~2~ is a
payment to John’s address @~b~. Let’s look at how the full node uses the
bloom filter (<<fig0619>>).

[[fig0619]]
.The full node uses the bloom filter to determine which transactions are “interesting” to the wallet.
image::{imagedir}/06-19.svg[{full-width}]

For each output in a transaction, the node tests whether any PKH
matches the filter. It starts with Tx~1~, which has a single output to
PKH~L~.  To test whether PKH~L~ matches the filter, it runs PKH~L~
through the same three hash functions as John’s wallet did when the
filter was created. The hash functions output the indexes `5`, `1`,
and `0`. The bits at index `5` and `0` are both `1`, but the bit at
index `1` is `0`.  A 0 bit means PKH~L~ definitely isn’t interesting
to John’s wallet. If John’s wallet was interested in PKH~L~, the
wallet would have added it to the filter, thus setting bit `1` to
`1`. Because PKH~L~ was the only PKH in Tx~1~, John’s wallet isn’t
interested in this transaction.

The next transaction is Tx~2~. It contains two PKHs: PKH~b~ and
PKH~X~.  It begins with PKH~b~. Running this PKH through the hash
functions gives the indexes `5`, `0`, and `3`. All three bits have the
value `1`. This means the node can’t say for sure if the transaction
is interesting to the wallet, but it can’t say that it’s definitely
_not_ interesting.  Testing any further PKHs in this transaction is
pointless because the node has already determined that Tx~2~ should be
sent to the wallet.

The last transaction has two outputs to PKH~Y~ and PKH~Z~. It starts
with PKH~Y~, which happens to point at `2`, `7`, and `4`. Both bits `4`
and `7` are `0`, which means PKH~Y~ definitely isn’t interesting to the
wallet. Let’s continue with PKH~Z~, which results in bits `2`, `3`, and
`0`. All three bits have the value `1`. This, again, means Tx~3~ _might_
be interesting to the wallet, so the node will send this transaction,
too. John’s wallet doesn’t actually contain PKH~Z~, but the bloom
filter aims to match more than needed to preserve some degree of
privacy. We call this a _false positive_ match.

The result of the bloom filtering is that the node will send Tx~2~ and
Tx~3~ to the wallet. How the transactions are sent is a totally
different story, described in <<merkle-trees>>.

WARNING: The following is challenging. Feel free to skip this part and
jump to <<ch06-periscope>>.

The previous description is a simplification of what really
happens. You tested only PKHs of the transaction outputs described,
which would capture all transactions that pay cookie tokens _to_ any
of John’s addresses. But what about transactions that are spending
_from_ John’s addresses? We could argue that the full node doesn’t
need to send those transactions to the wallet because the wallet
already knows about them, given that it created them in the first
place. Unfortunately, you do need to send those transactions, for two
reasons.

First, it might not be this wallet app that created the transaction.
John can have multiple wallet apps that generate addresses from the
same seed. For example, do you remember in <<ch04>> how a wallet can
be restored from a mnemonic sentence? This sentence can be used by
multiple wallet apps at the same time. John might want to make a
payment from one of the wallet apps and be notified of the payment in
the other wallet app so he can monitor the total balance in that app.

Second, John wants to be notified when the transaction is
confirmed. The wallet app might already have the transaction, but it’s
still marked as _unconfirmed_ in the app. John wants to know when the
transaction has been included in a block, so he needs the node to send
him this transaction when it’s in a block.

What the node really tests are the following items (<<fig0620>>):

* The txid of the transaction
* All transaction output (TXO) references in the inputs
* All data items in signature scripts
* All data items of the outputs

[[fig0620]]
.Several things in a transaction are tested through the bloom filter to determine whether the transaction is possibly interesting.
image::{imagedir}/06-20.svg[{half-width}]

For John’s wallet to be notified of spends, it needs to add either all
its public keys to the bloom filter or all its UTXO references.

===== Throttling privacy and data traffic

****
image::{imagedir}/u06-05.svg[]
****

The purpose of the bloom filter is to enhance user privacy. The level of
privacy can be controlled by tuning the ratio between the number of 1s
in the bloom filter and the bloom filter’s size. The more 1s in the
bloom filter in relation to the bloom filter’s size, the more false
positives. More false positives means the full node will send more
unrelated transactions to the wallet. More unrelated transactions means
more wasted data traffic but also improved privacy.

Let’s do some back-of-the-envelope calculations. The bloom filter in the
earlier example has 8 bits, of which five are 1s. A single hash
function’s output has a 5/8 probability of hitting a 1. For a single
test, the probability that all three hash functions hit a 1 is then
(5/8)^3^. The probability that a single test is negative—at least one of
the three hash functions points to a 0—is then 1 – (5/8)^3^. The full
node will perform several tests on each transaction, typically nine for
a transaction with two inputs and two outputs. Let’s check this against
the list of tests the full node performs:

* The txid of the transaction (1)

* All TXO references in the inputs (2)

* All data items in signature scripts (public key and signature × 2 =
  4)

* All data items of the outputs (2)

The probability that all nine tests are negative is (1 – (5/8)^3^)^9^ ≈
0.08. So, almost all—92/100—transactions will be sent to the wallet.
This shows that having only three 0s of 8 bits in the bloom filter won’t
help reduce the data much, but it protects your privacy better.

To get fewer false positives, John’s wallet must use a larger bloom
filter so the ratio (number of ones/bloom filter size) decreases.

Let’s define some symbols:

 t = Number of tests performed on a transaction (9)
 p = Probability of a transaction being deemed uninteresting
 r = Ratio of the number of 1s/bloom filter size

We can generalize our calculation as follows:

[stem] 
++++
(1-r^3)^t=p \Rightarrow 1-r^3=p^{\frac{1}{t}} \Rightarrow r^3=1-p^{\frac{1}{t}} \\
\Rightarrow r=\sqrt[3]{1-p^{\frac{1}{t}}}
++++

Let’s say you only want to get 1/10 of all transactions (given that all
transactions are like the previous transaction, with two inputs and two
outputs). How big do you have to make the bloom filter?

[stem]
++++
t = 9, p = \frac{9}{10} \\
r = \sqrt[3]{1-p^{\frac{1}{t}}}
  = \sqrt[3]{1-(\frac{9}{10})^{\frac{1}{9}}} ≈ 0.23
++++

This calculation means the bloom filter should be about 6/0.23 ≈ 26 bits
to get only 1/10 of all transactions. The bloom filter size must be a
multiple of 8 bits, so 26 bits isn’t allowed. We can round upward to 32
bits.

Remember that these are rough calculations based on somewhat false
assumptions regarding transaction characteristics. We also aren’t
considering that the number of 1s in the example isn’t strictly six but
can be anywhere from three to six, given that both John’s addresses
could have generated the same set of indexes. But this process should
help you get an idea of how big a bloom filter must be.

===== Problems with bloom filters

Bloom filters have been broadly used by many lightweight wallets, but
they have issues:

Privacy:: A node that receives bloom filters from a lightweight client
can, with high precision, determine what addresses belong to a wallet.
The more bloom filters collected, the higher the accuracy. See
<<web-bloom-filter-privacy>> for details.

Performance:: When a full node first receives a bloom filter from a
lightweight client, the node needs to scan the entire blockchain for
matching transactions. This scanning is processing and disk intensive
and can take several minutes, depending on the full node’s hardware.
This fact can be used maliciously to attack full nodes so they become
unresponsive, in a _denial-of-service_ (DoS) attack.

New Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), BIP157 and BIP158, have been
proposed that aim to solve these issues, but they haven’t been widely
implemented and tested yet. The general idea is to reverse the process
so a full node sends a filter to the lightweight wallet for each
block.  This filter contains information about what addresses the
block affects.  The lightweight client checks whether its addresses
match the filter and, if so, downloads the entire block. The block can
be downloaded from any source, not just the full node that sent the
filter.

[.periscope]
[[ch06-periscope]]
=== Where were we?

For the sake of orientation, <<fig0621>> shows part of what I sketched
out in <<wallet-connection>> in <<ch01>>, where Bob’s wallet was notified
of Alice’s payment to Bob.

[[fig0621]]
.A Bitcoin wallet is notified of an incoming payment by a full node.
image::{imagedir}/06-21.svg[{big-width}]

In the example in this chapter, John has sent a bloom filter to the
cafe’s full node to receive only information concerning him. The full
node has received a block that contains two transactions that are
interesting to John, at least according to John’s bloom filter.

The next thing that happens is that the new block’s header and the
potentially interesting transactions are sent to John’s wallet.

[id=merkle-trees]
=== Merkle trees

Now that the full node has determined which transactions to send to the
wallet, it needs to send the new block header and all transactions
John’s wallet might be interested in.

[[fig0622]]
.The full node feeds the lightweight wallet the block header and potentially relevant transactions.
image::{imagedir}/06-22.svg[{big-width}]

The full node has determined that transactions Tx~2~ and Tx~3~ need to
be sent to the wallet. If the node sends only the header and the two
transactions, then John’s wallet won’t be able to verify that the
transactions belong to the block. The merkle root depends on three
transactions, Tx~1~, Tx~2~, and Tx~3~, but the wallet only gets Tx~2~
and Tx~3~ from the full node. The wallet can’t re-create the merkle root
in the block header. It needs more information to verify that the
transactions are included in the block. Remember that you want to save
data traffic, so sending all transactions in the block isn’t good
enough.

==== Creating the merkle root

It’s time to reveal how Lisa created the merkle root. Suppose Lisa is
about to create the block header shown in <<fig0622>>. She needs to
calculate the combined hash of all transactions, called the merkle root
(<<fig0623>>). You calculate the merkle root by creating a hierarchy of
cryptographic hashes, a merkle tree.

[[fig0623]]
.Lisa creates a merkle root from the transactions in a block.
image::{imagedir}/06-23.svg[{big-width}]

The transactions are ordered the same way they are in the block. If
the number of items is odd, the last item is duplicated and added
last. This extra item isn’t added to the block; it’s only duplicated
temporarily for the merkle tree calculation.

Each item (transaction, in this case) is hashed with double
SHA256. This results in four hash values of 256 bits each.

The hash values are pairwise _concatenated_, meaning two hashes are
merged by appending the second hash after the first hash. For example,
`abc` concatenated with `def` becomes `abcdef`.

The four hash values have now become two concatenated values. Because
two is an even number, you don’t add an extra item at the end. The two
concatenated values are each hashed separately, resulting in two
256-bit hashes.

These two hash values are concatenated into a single 512-bit
value. This value is hashed, resulting in the 256-bit merkle
root. This merkle root is written into the block header. If any
transaction is added, deleted, or changed, the merkle root must be
recalculated (<<fig0624>>).

[[fig0624]]
.A change in the transactions will cause a change in the merkle root, making the signature invalid.
image::{imagedir}/06-24.svg[{half-width}]

This is nice, because when Lisa signs the block header, you know that
if someone tampers with the transactions in it, the signature becomes
invalid.

[[create-proof]]
==== Proving that a transaction is in a block

The full node wants to send Tx~2~ and Tx~3~ to John’s wallet because
it thinks those transactions might be interesting to John’s
wallet. The full node wants to prove to the wallet that both Tx~2~ and
Tx~3~ are included in the block. But let’s begin with proving only a
single transaction, Tx~2~. We’ll look at a bigger, more complex
example later in this chapter.

How can the full node provide proof to the wallet that Tx~2~ is
included in the block? It can provide a _partial merkle tree_ that
connects Tx~2~ to the merkle root in the block header. The general
idea is to send the bare minimum to the lightweight wallet—just enough
to verify that Tx~2~ is in the block. In this example, the node will
send the stuff in <<fig0625>> to the lightweight wallet.

[[fig0625]]
.The bare minimum to prove Tx~2~ is in the block. The full node sends this to the wallet.
image::{imagedir}/06-25.svg[{half-width}]

The lightweight wallet will then use this information to verify that
Tx~2~ is in the block by calculating the intermediary hashes toward the
root, and verify that the hash of Tx~2~ is among the hashes provided by
the full node (<<fig0626>>).

[[fig0626]]
.The lightweight wallet verifies that Tx~2~ is in the block by reconstructing the merkle root.
image::{imagedir}/06-26.svg[{half-width}]

The hash functions have been removed from the diagram to make it easier
to read. The wallet can now be certain Tx~2~ is in the block.

==== How it really works

[WARNING]

The following describes in detail how to create and verify a partial
merkle tree.  If you want, you can skip this part and jump to
<<security-of-lightweight-wallets>>.

===== Creating the partial merkle tree

The partial merkle tree is a pruned version of the full merkle tree,
containing only the parts needed to prove Tx~2~ is part of the tree.
The full node sends three things to the wallet:

1. The block header
2. The partial merkle tree
3. Tx~2~

Let’s construct the partial merkle tree. The full node knows the number
of transactions in the block, so it knows the merkle tree’s shape. To
construct the partial merkle tree, the full node examines the hashes in
the merkle tree, starting at the merkle root and moving downward in the
tree, left branch first (<<fig0627>>).

[[fig0627]]
.The full node constructs a partial merkle tree that connects Tx~2~ to the merkle root in the block header.
image::{imagedir}/06-27.svg[{full-width}]
The partial merkle tree consists of

* A number indicating the total number of transactions in the block
* A list of flags
* A list of hashes

At each step, you do two things with the current hash, as outlined in
the following table:


1. Add the flag to the list of flags. ✘ means there’s nothing
interesting in this hash’s branch; ✔ means this branch contains an
interesting transaction.

2. If the flag is ✘, or if this hash is an interesting txid, add the
hash to the list of hashes.

[%autowidth,cols="5",options="header"]
|===
| Step| Commits to interesting txid? | List of flags
| Is flag ✘, or is the hash an interesting txid?| List of hashes

| 1 | yes | ✔     | no  | -
| 2 | yes | ✔✔    | no  | -
| 3 | no  | ✔✔✘   | yes | 3
| 4 | yes | ✔✔✘✔  | yes | 3 4
| 5 | no  | ✔✔✘✔✘ | yes | 3 4 5
|===

This ordering of the steps is called _depth first_, meaning you
always move downward in the tree as far as you can before moving
sideways. But you won’t go down in tree branches that don’t contain
any interesting transactions. This is noted in the list of flags as
✘. You stop at ✘ because you don’t want to send unnecessary data to
the wallet, hence the term _partial_ merkle tree.

Now that the full node has created this partial merkle tree, the node
will send the block header and the partial merkle tree to the wallet,
and then send the actual transaction Tx~2~. The block header together
with the partial merkle tree are often referred to as a _merkle
proof_.

===== Verifying the partial merkle tree

The wallet has received a block header, a partial merkle tree, and the
transaction Tx~2~ from the full node. That’s all the wallet needs to
verify that Tx~2~ is indeed included in the block. The goal is to verify
that there’s a way to “connect” Tx~2~ to the merkle root in the block
header. It starts with verifying the partial merkle tree (<<fig0628>>).

[[fig0628]]
.The wallet verifies the partial merkle tree.
image::{imagedir}/06-28.svg[{full-width}]


Use the number of transactions (three) received from the full node to
build the merkle tree’s structure. The wallet knows how a merkle tree
with three transactions looks.

Use the list of flags and the list of hashes to attach hashes to the
merkle tree in depth-first order, as follows.

[%autowidth,cols="2*,>,2*,>",options="header"]
|===
| Step| Next flag from list | Remaining list of flags |
Is flag ✘, or are you at the lowest level?| Attach hash | List of hashes

| 1 | ✔ | ✔✘✔✘ | no  | - | 3 4 5
| 2 | ✔ | ✘✔✘  | no  | - | 3 4 5
| 3 | ✘ | ✔✘   | yes | 3 | 4 5
| 4 | ✔ | ✘    | yes | 4 | 5
| 5 | ✘ |      | yes | 5 |
|===

The wallet has now attached enough hashes (3, 4, and 5) to the merkle
tree to fill in the blanks upward toward the partial merkle tree root.
First, the hash of step 2 is calculated from 3 and 4; then the root is
calculated from 2 and 5.

Compare the calculated merkle root with the merkle root in the block
header—the actual merkle root—and verify that they’re the same. Also,
check that the hash of Tx~2~ is among the list of hashes received from
the full node (<<fig0629>>).

[[fig0629]]
.The wallet checks that the merkle roots match and that Tx~2~ is included in the list of hashes. If so, Tx~2~ is proven to belong to the block.
image::{imagedir}/06-29.svg[{big-width}]

If the transaction turns out to match one of the hashes in the partial
merkle tree, and if the partial merkle tree root matches the merkle
root in the block header, the full node has proven that Tx~2~ is part
of the block.

But the full node wanted to send two transactions from this block. How
would the merkle proof look with two transactions? Do you send
multiple merkle proofs? No—we’ll leave this as an exercise at the end
of this chapter.

[[bigger-trees]]
===== Handling thousands of transactions in a block

The block in the previous example contained only three
transactions. You didn’t save much space sending the header, the
partial merkle tree, and Tx~2~. You could just as well send all three
txids instead of the partial merkle tree—that would be much
simpler. But the gains with merkle proofs become more apparent when
the number of transactions in a block increases.

Suppose the full node just verified a block containing 12
transactions.  It has determined, by testing all transactions against
the wallet’s bloom filter, that two of the transactions are
potentially interesting to the wallet. <<fig0630>> shows how this
would look.

[[fig0630]]
.Constructing a partial merkle tree from 12 transactions and two interesting transactions
image::{imagedir}/06-30.svg[{full-width}]

The full node has to send only the block header, the number 12, 14
flags, and seven hashes. This sums to about 240 bytes, far less data
than sending the block header and all 12 txids (about 464 bytes).

Let’s check some rough numbers to see how the merkle proof compares in
size to the full block and the simplistic approach of sending all txids
as the number of transactions grows (<<tab0601>>).

[.inbitcoin]
.80-byte header
****
Bitcoin’s block header is always 80 bytes. The cookie token block
headers are slightly bigger because of the signature. In the next
chapter, you’ll fix the block header to match Bitcoin’s more closely;
and in <<ch11>>, we’ll talk about the version, which is also in the
block header.
****

<<tab0601>> assumes that all transactions are 250 bytes and that you
only want to prove a single transaction. The block size is calculated
as the 80-byte block header plus the number of transactions
times 250. The simple proof is calculated as the 80-byte block header
plus the number of transactions times 32. The merkle proof is
calculated as the 80-byte block header plus the length of the list of
hashes times 32. Ignore the flags and number of transactions, because
they’re negligible.

The merkle proofs don’t grow as fast as the simple proofs, because
merkle proofs grow _logarithmically_ with the number of transactions,
whereas simple proofs grow _linearly_ with the number of transactions.
When the block _doubles_ in size, the merkle proof size roughly
increases _by a constant term_ of 32 bytes, whereas the simple proof
doubles in size.

[[security-of-lightweight-wallets]]
=== Security of lightweight wallets

Lightweight wallets seem like a nice touch for the cookie token system.
They certainly are, but users should be aware of what they’re missing
out on compared to full nodes.

Full nodes verify the blockchain’s complete history and know for sure
that the money a transaction spends exists and that the signatures are
valid.

A lightweight wallet knows the entire chain of block headers. It will
verify that Lisa has correctly signed each block header. When the wallet
receives a transaction and a merkle proof, it can check that the
transaction is contained in the block and that Lisa signed that block.
But it can’t verify a lot of other things. For example:

* That the script programs in the transaction all return “OK,” which
usually means verifying the signatures of all inputs

* That the spent outputs aren’t already spent

* That it receives all relevant transactions

The lightweight wallet also doesn’t know what rules the full node is
following. The full node might have adopted a rule that pays double
the reward to Lisa. A typical full node would consider any block that
pays too much to Lisa as invalid because that isn’t a rule it signed
up for, and would drop the block.

The lightweight wallet needs to trust the full node to verify those
things on its behalf and that the full node is following the rules the
wallet expects it to follow.

The full node can hide relevant transactions to the wallet. This means
the wallet won’t be notified about some incoming or outgoing
transactions.

A lightweight wallet gives verification responsibility to the full
node it’s connected to. Suppose Lisa produces an invalid block—for
example, a block that contains a transaction that spends an output
that doesn’t exist. When the full node receives this block, it should
verify the block and drop it because it’s invalid. But there might be
occasions when the full node, deliberately or accidentally, doesn’t
detect the error. Perhaps the cafe is in cahoots with Lisa to fool
John—who knows?  The cafe and Lisa can, at least temporarily, make
John believe he’s received money that he didn’t receive.

John can take at least two measures to reduce the risk of being fooled
by a full node:

Connect to multiple full nodes simultaneously:: Most lightweight
wallets in Bitcoin do this automatically. All full nodes that John’s
wallet is connected to must take active part in the conspiracy in order to fool John (<<fig0631>>).

[[fig0631]]
.John’s wallet is connected to multiple full nodes. Hopefully, they don’t all collude to fool John.
image::{imagedir}/06-31.svg[{half-width}]

[.inbitcoin]
.Trusted node
****
Many Bitcoin wallets support connecting to a trusted node. Ask your
wallet software’s development team if you’re unsure.
****

Connect to a trusted node:: A _trusted node_ is a full node that John
runs himself on a computer he controls (<<fig0632>>). This way, John can
use a lightweight wallet on his mobile phone to save data traffic while
still being sure he receives correct information from his full node.

[[fig0632]]
.John has set up a trusted node that his lightweight wallet connects to.
image::{imagedir}/06-32.svg[{half-width}]

The last option is useful if John is concerned some full nodes might
adopt rule changes he doesn’t agree with. The only way to be absolutely
sure you follow the rules _you want_ is to run your own full node.

=== Recap

This chapter has described the blockchain and how it enables full nodes
to prove if Lisa has tried to delete or change transactions. The
blockchain is a sequence of blocks that are connected through
cryptographic hashes.

image::{imagedir}/u06-08.svg[{full-width}]

The merkle root in the block header is the combined hash of all
contained transactions. This hash is created by hashing the transactions
in a merkle tree structure. Hashes are concatenated pairwise, and the
result is hashed to get one level closer to the root.

image::{imagedir}/u06-10.svg[{half-width}]

A full node can prove to a lightweight wallet that a transaction is in a
block by sending a merkle proof to the wallet. The merkle proof consists
of the block header and a partial merkle tree. The merkle proof grows
logarithmically with the number of transactions in the block.

image::{imagedir}/u06-11.svg[{big-width}]

For privacy reasons, wallets don’t want just the transactions they’re
actually interested in. To obfuscate what addresses belong to it, the
wallet uses bloom filters to subscribe to more transactions than those
that are actually interesting. It creates a bloom filter and sends it to
the full node.

image::{imagedir}/u06-12.svg[{half-width}]

The full node tests various stuff from the transactions—for example,
PKHs in outputs—using the three hash functions. If any such item hashes
to indexes all containing `1`, then the node will send the transaction.
If not, it won’t send the transaction.

This chapter has solved the issue with deleted or changed transactions.
Lisa can’t change the contents of the blockchain without being proven a
fraud.

Lisa can still censor transactions. She can refuse to confirm
transactions being sent to her. She has ultimate power over what goes
into the blockchain and what doesn’t. In <<ch07>>, we’ll make it much
harder for a single actor like Lisa to make such decisions.

==== System changes

We’ve introduced the blockchain, which replaces the spreadsheet on
Lisa’s computer (<<tab0602>>). This chapter also introduced a new concept
specifically for the cookie token system: the shared folder. This folder
will be replaced by a peer-to-peer network of full nodes in <<ch08>>.

[[tab0602]]
[%autowidth]

This blockchain is close to how Bitcoin’s blockchain works but with an
important difference: Lisa signs the blocks using digital signatures,
whereas in Bitcoin, they’re signed using proof of work.

. Suppose that you’ve calculated the root of a partial merkle tree, as

=== Summary

* Transactions are placed in blocks that Lisa signs to hold her
accountable if she tries to delete transactions.

* Each block signature commits to the transactions in that block and
all previous blocks so history can’t be tampered with without
re-signing the fraudulent block and all subsequent blocks.

* The transactions in a block are collectively hashed in a merkle tree
structure to create a merkle root that’s written in the block header.
This makes it possible to create a lightweight wallet.

* Lightweight wallets save bandwidth but at the cost of reduced
  security.

* Lightweight wallet security is reduced because such wallets can’t
fully verify a transaction and because a full node can hide
transactions from them.

* The only way to be absolutely sure the block rules are followed is
to run your own full node.

* The security of a lightweight wallet can be improved by connecting
to multiple full nodes or a trusted node.

* Lisa can still censor transactions.
