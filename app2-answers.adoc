=== Chapter 2

. 256 bits.

. 32 bytes.

. A cryptographic hash function.

. `061a` is `6*256 + (16 + 10) = 1,536 + 26 = 1,562` in decimal
form. The binary form of `06` is `0000 0110`, and the binary form of
`1a` is `0001 1010`, so the full binary representation is `0000 0110
0001 1010`.

. No. If it was possible, the function wouldn’t be
second-pre-image-resistant.

. Properties 2 and 4 are lacking.

. Second-pre-image resistance is stopping the attacker. The attacker
needs to find an input that gives the same hash as a certain other
input: the cat picture.

. The money supply increase rate will decrease over time because the
reward to Lisa halves every 4 years. This means the total amount of CT
to ever be created will be about 21,000,000.

. The coworkers have read access to the spreadsheet. They can watch
the spreadsheet and verify that Lisa doesn’t reward herself too much or
too often.

. The private key is created using a random number generator of
some sort. A simple one is a coin that you flip 256 times to generate
your 256-bit private key. You can also use your operating system’s
built-in random number generator.

. The private key.

. The message is hashed because you want signatures to be small and
fixed in size. You don’t want the signatures to be big just because the
signed message is big.

. Mallory would need John’s private key to steal cookies from him.
She would also need his name, John, to write into the email to Lisa, but
that’s easily available in the spreadsheet.

. Fred can use your public key to encrypt the message and send the
encrypted message to you. You can then decrypt that message using your
private key.

. You sign the message using your private key and write the digital
signature onto the note in the bottle. Fred can then verify that the
signature is in fact made with your private key. He does this by using
your public key to decrypt the signature and comparing the decrypted
hash with the actual hash of the message. If they match, he can be sure
the message is from you.


=== Chapter 3

. The PKH is made short because a) it makes the spreadsheet smaller
in size and b) it makes cookie token addresses (and Bitcoin addresses)
shorter to write for a user.

. Yes, you can. There’s a base58check decoding algorithm that does
this.

. It’s used by a payer to translate the recipient’s address into a
PKH. The payer needs to write the recipient’s PKH in the email to Lisa.

. Let’s base58-encode 0047 step by step:
+
[arabic]
.. Remove leading 00 bytes. There is one, which leaves you with 47.

.. Convert to a decimal number: 47 in hex is 4 × 16 + 7 = 71 in decimal.

.. Divide 71 by 58: 71 = 1 × 58 + 13. The quotient is 1, and the remainder
is 13.

.. Divide the quotient, 1, by 58: 1 = 0 × 58 + 1. The quotient is 0, and
the remainder is 1.

.. Look up the remainders 13 and 1. Result: E and 2.

.. Add a 1 for the removed 00 byte in step 1, which results in E21.

.. Reverse it: 12E. Done.

. The 4-byte checksum.

. He must make two separate payments. For example: payment 1 pays 2
CT from @~1~ to the cafe, and payment 2 pays 8 CT from @~2~ to the cafe.
Another way is to first pay 2 CT from @~1~ to @~2~ and then pay 10 CT
from @~2~ to the cafe.

. Yes it is. Base58check-encode the PKHs to get the addresses.

. No, because the spreadsheet contains PKHs. Because cryptographic
hash functions are one-way functions, you can’t go from PKH to public
key.

. They can look at the amounts. Many of the 10 CT payments are
probably cookie purchases.

. The bad guy can’t steal cookie tokens because he needs the public
key to exploit the flaw in the public key derivation function. The
spreadsheet contains PKHs; the bad guy can’t get the public key from it.

. The bad guy needs the private key to sign fraudulent emails to
Lisa. Even though he can reverse RIPEMD160, he’d still need to pre-image
attack SHA256 and reverse the public key derivation function to get to a
working private key.

=== Chapter 4

. `bitcoin:155gWNamPrwKwu5D6JZdaLVKvxbpoKsp5S?amount=50`

. Each character corresponds to 6 bits of entropy because 2^6^ = 64.
Ten such characters make 60 bits of entropy, which corresponds to 60
coin flips.

. The four problems:

* Passwords are easily forgotten.

* Randomness is hard.

* The security of a password decreases as technology improves.

* You need to keep track of two items: the backup _and_ the
password. This increases the risk that the backup is lost.

. The seed is created by first generating a huge random number, then
the random number is encoded as a mnemonic sentence, and lastly, the
mnemonic sentence is used to generate the seed.

. An xprv consists of a private key and a chain code.

. An xpub consists of a public key and a chain code.

. The xprv at path `m/2/1` and the wanted index `7`.

. No, you would need xprv `m/2/1` to derive xpub `M/2/1/7'`. You
first derive hardened xprv `m/2/1/7'` from `m/2/1` using hardened xprv
derivation and then calculate the xpub `M/2/1/7'` from `m/2/1/7'`.

. You can use the following procedure to get the master xprv:
+
[arabic]
.. Use master xpub `M` to derive xpub `M/4` and remember the left-half
hash, L~4~.

.. Use `M/4` to derive the left-half hash L~41~ at index 1.

.. Subtract L~41~ from the private key `m/4/1` to get private key `m/4`.

.. Subtract L~4~ from the private key `m/4` to get private key `m`.

.. `m` together with the chain code of xpub `M` is the master xprv.

. Yes, you’d be able to steal all funds in any addresses because
you can calculate the master xprv.

. The victim could have used hardening to generate `m/4'` instead.
This way, you wouldn’t be able to get the master xprv. If you stole
`m/4'/1` and the master xpub, you would only be able to steal funds on
the `m/4'/1` key. You wouldn’t be able to calculate the `M/4'` xpub.

. The employees can import the xpub for the counter sales account.
They will then be able to generate any public keys under that account
and thus generate as many addresses as they need without ever having to
know any private keys.

. Your (and Anita’s) wallet can generate 10 addresses ahead of time
and monitor the spreadsheet for those addresses. If Anita gets paid to
one of these addresses—probably the first of those 10—then your wallet
won’t reuse that address when you request a payment from a customer. You
would instead take the next unused address.

=== Chapter 5

. You would spend the 4 CT and the 7 CT outputs. The new outputs
would be 10 CT to the cafe and 1 CT in change to an address you control.

. They’re used in inputs to reference transactions from which to
spend outputs.

. Because you can’t spend part of a transaction output. You either
spend the output or you don’t. If the spent output contains more value
than you’re paying, you need to give back change to yourself.

. In the signature scripts in the inputs.

. Because the verifiers need to know what public key to verify the
signature with. You can’t verify the signature with a PKH, so you need
to explicitly reveal the public key in the signature script.

. The signature scripts are cleaned so that verifiers don’t have to
know the order in which the inputs are signed.

. Each output of a transaction contains a pubkey script. It contains
the second part of a script program. The first part will be provided
later, when the output is spent.

. The Script program must end with OK on top of the stack.

. A p2sh address always starts with a `3`. You can also recognize it
by base58check-decoding it and looking at the first byte. If that byte
is 05, it’s a p2sh address.

. You’ll create a transaction with one input and three outputs:
+
image::{imagedir}/appb-01.svg[{full-width}]

. 10,003 UTXOs. You remove two UTXOs by spending two outputs, and
you add five new UTXOs. The net effect on the UTXO set is thus +3 UTXOs.

. The pubkey script can be, for example, `1`. The spending input
can have an empty signature script. The full Script program just puts a
`1` on the stack. A result stack with non-zero on top means OK.

. `OP_ADD 10 OP_EQUAL`. This will first add the two top items on
the stack and put the result back on top. Then, you’ll push the number
10 to the stack and compare the two top items. If they’re equal, OK will
be pushed to the stack.

. Yes. Your full node verifies everything in the spreadsheet from
the very first transaction up to the transaction containing your money
from Faiza. It verifies (among other things) the following:

* Lisa created the expected number of coinbase transactions with the
correct amounts in them.

* For each transaction in the spreadsheet, the value sum of outputs
doesn’t exceed the value sum of inputs.

* All signatures from Faiza’s payment back to all coinbase transactions
are OK.

. If there are several UTXOs to the same PKH, then as soon as one
of them is spent, the security of the other UTXOs to the same PKH will
be degraded. This is because you remove a layer of security, the
cryptographic hash function. From this point, you rely solely on the
public key derivation function to be secure. You can avoid this problem
by using unique addresses for all your incoming payments. Then, all your
UTXOs will have different PKHs.

=== Chapter 6

. By the previous block’s block ID, which is the hash of the
previous block’s header.

. The merkle root of a block commits to all transactions in that
block.

. Lisa’s block signature commits to the timestamp, the merkle root
(and indirectly all transactions in this block), and the previous block
ID (and indirectly the whole blockchain before this block).

. The first transaction in each block is a coinbase transaction.
This coinbase transaction creates 50 new cookie tokens and sends them to
Lisa’s cookie token address.

. All transactions. The hash functions will all result in an index
containing `1` because there are no zeroes in the bloom filter. Any item
in the transaction that you test will be a positive.

. The following are tested:

* The txid together with the index that identifies the output to spend

* All data items in the signature scripts

* All data items in the pubkey scripts

* The txid of the transaction

. They aren’t pre-image resistant, collision resistant, or
second-pre-image resistant. The output space is small—typically just a
few hundred to a few thousand numbers. It will take only a fraction of a
second to find a pre-image of, for example, `172`.

. The rightmost leaf must be copied to make an even number of
leaves. The same goes for the next level, where the third hash needs to
be copied.
+
image::{imagedir}/appb-02.svg[{full-width}]

. If Lisa’s private block-signing key is stolen, the thief can
create blocks in Lisa’s name. Also, if a bad guy replaces Lisa’s
block-signing public key on one or more sources, such as the bulletin
board or the intranet, the bad guy can fool people into accepting blocks
not signed by Lisa.

. Lisa can censor transactions, and the shared folder administrator
can censor blocks.

. a) Yes, a new node that downloads all blocks from the shared
folder will notice that there are two versions of the block. b) Yes, an
old node that has already downloaded the original block will detect that
there is an alternate version of the block.

. The bits at indexes `1`, `5`, `6`, and `7` are set to 1 and the
other to 0. The full node would _not_ send this transaction to the
lightweight wallet. Nothing that’s tested hashes to only indexes where
the bits are `1`. This was something of a trick question, because the
spent txid and the output index of the spent transaction aren’t tested
individually, so 1,6,6 will never be considered by the full node.
+
image::{imagedir}/appb-03.svg[{big-width}]

. The partial merkle tree is
+
 Number of tx: 3
 Flags: ✔✔✘✔✔✔
 Hashes 3 4 6

. The interesting transactions are numbers 7 and 13, or leaf numbers 6
and 10 from the left. You’ve already seen the solution in
<<bigger-trees>>, but I provide it here as well for reference.
+
image::{imagedir}/appb-04.svg[{full-width}]

. You need to verify the following:

* The transaction’s txid is in the list of hashes.

* The root of the partial merkle tree matches the merkle root in the block
header.

* The block header is correctly signed.

=== Chapter 7

. She single-handedly decides what transactions get confirmed.

. The probability of censorship will decrease because all miners
must cooperatively decide to censor a transaction to succeed. Otherwise,
your transactions will eventually be confirmed by some noncolluding
miner.

. Miners can cheat with random numbers. You can’t prove whether a
miner cheated.

. Verify that the block ID of a block is lower than the target in
the block header, and that the target is the agreed-on target.

. By repeatedly changing the nonce and hashing (double SHA256) the
block header until the block ID (the block header hash) is lower than
the target.

. The branch with the most accumulated proof of work. This isn’t
necessarily the same as the branch with the most blocks.

. A miner with a hashrate of 100 Mhash/s can perform 100,000,000
tries per second to find a valid proof of work.

. The target will increase. If the 2,016 blocks take 15 days instead
of the goal of 14 days, then it’s too hard to find blocks, so you need
to decrease the difficulty, which means increasing the target.

. 50%. But if you plan to give up at some point, your chances will
decrease.

. The small block will reach the other miners more quickly than the
big block because a smaller block travels a computer network faster than
a big block. The small block is probably also quicker to verify than the
big block. Miners will probably download and verify the small block
faster than the big block and continue their mining activity on top of
the small block, which gives the small block a higher probability of
becoming part of the strongest chain.

. The target will decrease by a factor of 3/4. The time to produce
2,016 blocks is 1.5 weeks; the first 1,008 blocks take 1 week, and the
next 1,008 blocks take 0.5 weeks. So, the new target becomes
+
[stem]
++++
N=
O*\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\frac{1}{4} & \mbox{if } T \lt 0.5 \\
\frac{T}{2} & \mbox{if } 0.5 \leq T \leq 8 \\
4 & \mbox{if } 8 \lt T
\end{array}
=O*\frac{1.5}{2}=O*\frac{3}{4}
\right.
++++

. Selma has the majority of the hashrate. As long as she plays by
the same rules as everyone else, she’s going to earn a lot of block
rewards. When she breaks the rules by changing the target prematurely,
all full nodes except Selma’s will discard her blocks. Selma will
continue working on her own branch of the blockchain with her new rules,
while all the rest will work on the branch with the old rules. The
branches will be mutually incompatible. The hashrate of the old branch
will drop to 48%, but the system will tick on, and everyone will
continue their daily lives as normal. Selma, on the other hand, will
spend a lot of electricity and time on her new branch, and no one will
buy her block rewards. The value of her mined coins will probably be
close to zero because she’s not following the rules. Selma is a loser.

. The fee-per-byte metric used by most miners will be very low. For
every byte of transaction data the miner puts in its block, it will lose
a little competitiveness because the block will get bigger and thus
slower to transport over the network and to verify. If the fee per byte
for the transaction isn’t high enough to compensate for the lost
competitiveness, the miner probably won’t include it.

=== Chapter 8

. The shared folder is a bad idea because it gives the shared folder
administrator absolute power over what blocks to allow. Also, if the
administrator decides to start mining, he can shut off all competition
and have complete power of the system.

. To relay a block or a transaction means to pass it on to peers.

. An `inv` message is used to announce to peers that you have a
certain block or transaction; `inv` stands for inventory.

. It will run the transaction through the bloom filter it got from
the wallet. If any tested item in the transaction matches the filter,
the node will send the transaction to the lightweight wallet.

. The full node sends an `inv` to the lightweight wallet after
consulting the bloom filter. The wallet can then fetch the transaction
if it doesn’t already have it.

. The block header.

. Because the cafe doesn’t have to obfuscate to its trusted node
what addresses belong to the wallet. It sends a very big bloom filter to
save data traffic on its mobile phone; a bloom filter that contains
mostly zeroes will send almost no false positives.

. She would verify the signature of the program using the public key
she knows belongs to the Bitcoin Core development team. She does this to
avoid being tricked into running malicious software.

. Using a DNS server to get a list of IP addresses for a DNS seed (a
DNS name) configured in Bitcoin Core, asking trusted friends, and using
hardcoded addresses shipped with Bitcoin Core.

. The node’s peers will announce any new blocks by sending
`headers` messages to the node, even during its synchronization process.

. You need to convince the cafe, Qi, and Tom to hide blocks from
Lisa. You can bribe them or threaten them.

. She sends an `inv` message to Rashid’s node containing the two
transaction IDs.

. Your node starts the synchronization process, which will look
like this:
+
image::{imagedir}/appb-06.svg[{full-width}]

=== Chapter 9

. At least one of the inputs must have a sequence number strictly
less than `ffffffff`.

. The median of the timestamps of the 11 previous blocks must be
strictly later than 2019-12-25 00:00:00.

. In the rightmost 16 bits of the sequence number.

. Two transactions on each blockchain: one for the contract
transaction and one for the swap transaction.

. With fake PKHs, the data must be stored forever in the UTXO set
because Bitcoin nodes can’t distinguish between fake PKHs and real ones.
The nodes won’t be able to tell if the output is unspendable or not.
With an `OP_RETURN` output, the node knows that the output is
unspendable and thus doesn’t have to keep it in the UTXO set.

. Your first transaction paid a too-small fee and got stuck pending.
You then want to replace it with a new transaction that pays a higher
fee.

. Absolute lock time: a transaction is invalid until a certain block
height or time. Relative lock time: an input of a transaction is invalid
until the spent output has been confirmed for a certain number of blocks
or a certain time period.

. The redeem script contains two branches of code. The first branch
will require that both you and Ruth sign to spend the 2 BTC. This can be
done at any time. To spend the 2 BTC using the second branch requires
that all of the following conditions are met:
+
--
* You have waited until New Year’s Eve.
* Beth has signed the transaction.
* You or Ruth signs the transaction.

To be precise, you and Ruth can spend using the first branch with the
following signature script (excluding the redeem script):

 0 <your sig> <ruth sig> 1

The second branch can be spent at the earliest on New Year’s Eve with

 0 <your or ruths sig> <beth sig> 0

The rightmost digit in both these signature scripts will select what
branch to use; the rest fulfill the requirement in the respective
branch.

The time-locked branch ensures that Beth has no power to collude with
either you or Ruth before New Year’s Eve.
--

. No. The redeem script isn’t known to the nodes until the output is
spent. And because you can’t spend an `OP_RETURN` redeem script, nodes
will never know about the redeem script. The node will thus never know
that this is an unspendable output.

. A full node that receives a transaction will keep it in memory
until it’s included in a block. If a second, conflicting transaction
arrives, the node will drop that second transaction and not relay it. It
will consider the first-seen transaction as the “real” one and the
second transaction as a double-spend attempt. Nodes (including miners)
aren’t required to follow this policy because it’s just a policy.

. Miners can always select whatever valid transactions they want to
include in their blocks. Thus all transactions are in a way replaceable.
A miner can offer replacement as a service—that is, upload a
double-spend transaction with a high fee via the miner’s website to have
it confirmed in the miner’s next winning block.
+
It is, of course, simpler for normal users to replace a transaction that
has opted in to RBF. But using services like the aforementioned one is
simple enough for a motivated thief. The difference in security
therefore isn’t as big as you might think.

=== Chapter 10

. The signature scripts.

. A transaction, T~2~, that spends an output of an unconfirmed
transaction, T~1~, can become invalid if T~1~ is changed into T~1M~
while being broadcast, and T~1M~ gets confirmed. This causes a lot of
problems for contracts.

. The time to verify a legacy transaction increases four times when
the number of inputs doubles. This is because

* You need to verify twice the number of signatures.

* Each signature takes double the time to verify because the transaction
to hash has doubled in size.

. To verify that the transaction is included in a block, the
lightweight wallet needs to calculate the transaction’s txid. The wallet
needs the signatures to calculate the txid because they’re included in
the txid.

. The new behavior of `OP_NOP5` must, if it succeeds, be exactly
like the old behavior of `OP_NOP5`. This means it should have no effect
on the stack if it succeeds.

. a (p2wpkh) and c (p2wsh) are segwit addresses. d is a p2sh
address, but it might contain a nested p2wpkh or p2wsh payment in the
redeem script. We can’t say for sure. But the address is a p2sh address,
not a segwit address.

. The witness version is used to make future upgrades easier. The
rule is that unknown witness versions are accepted. When a new witness
version is deployed, old nodes will accept any payment that spends
outputs with that new witness version. This avoids causing old and new
nodes to follow different branches of the blockchain.

. All data items in the signature script are pushed to the stack.
No such items exist in the signature script, so there’s nothing to do
there. Then, `00` will be pushed followed by `c805…cba8`. The Script
program is then finished, and the top item on the stack is checked. It’s
not zero, which means the spending is valid.

. The new node will notice that the output has the segwit pattern.
It will also notice that the witness version is `00` and that the
witness program is 20 bytes. That means this is a p2wpkh output. To
spend such an output, the signature script must be empty, and the
witness must contain exactly a signature and the pubkey corresponding to
the witness program, `PKH~Y~`. The p2wpkh template is filled in using
the signature and public key from the witness field and the PKH from the
pubkey script (the witness program). The filled-in template is then run
normally.

. The fee merkle root can be placed in the right branch under the
witness commitment. But you also need to put the fee merkle root in the
witness for the coinbase input so that old segwit nodes can verify the
witness root hash.

. An old segwit node will verify the block exactly as before. The
witness reserved value will be taken from the witness of the coinbase
input. Using the hash from the witness lets the old node build the
witness commitment and compare it with the hash in the `OP_RETURN`
output, but it won’t know that the witness reserved value is a fee
merkle root. Old nodes thus won’t be able to verify the fee merkle tree.
+
A new node will do the same verification as an old node, but it will
also calculate the fee merkle root and compare it to the hash in the
coinbase’s witness.

=== Chapter 11

. A soft fork tightens the consensus rules. This means blocks
created by Bitcoin New nodes are guaranteed to be accepted by Bitcoin
Old nodes.

. &#x00a0;
+
[loweralpha]
.. The New branch will get wiped out by the Old branch.

.. It will _eventually_ get wiped out when the Old branch catches
up with the New branch and surpasses it. This can take quite a few
blocks, depending on the initial deficit.

.. Bitcoin New could be equipped with wipeout protection—for
example, by requiring that the first block in the split have a certain
property that’s not valid in the Old chain. Bitcoin Cash, for example,
required that the first block be > 1,000,000 bytes.

. No, it will be outperformed by the New branch, and the Old branch
will pretty quickly be wiped out, or reorged.

. 2,016 blocks. The `LOCKED_IN` state is always one retarget
period.

. Both. Old nodes can create a block that’s not valid according to
New nodes. Conversely, New nodes can create a block that’s not valid
according to Old nodes.

. If the New nodes don’t have a majority of the hashrate, the Old
nodes can cause a lasting blockchain split. This would effectively
result in two cryptocurrencies.

. Replay protection is desirable because a transaction intended for
one branch of the split shouldn’t risk ending up on the other branch.

. Yes. Suppose the 11 timestamps before B~1~, sorted by value, are
+
--
[subs="normal"]
 a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d ≤ e ≤ MTP~1~ ≤ g ≤ h ≤ i ≤ j ≤ k

To calculate MTP~2~ of block B~2~ following B~1~, add T~1~ to this list.
Because a timestamp of a block needs to be strictly later than the MTP
of the block, T~1~ must be sorted to the right of MTP~1~ in the list.
For example:

[subs="normal"]
 a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d ≤ e ≤ MTP~1~ ≤ g ≤ h ≤ T~1~ ≤ i ≤ j ≤ k

You must also remove the timestamp of the block with lowest height from
the list of timestamps. No matter what timestamp you remove, MTP~2~ will
be either MTP~1~ (if you remove a timestamp to the right of it), or the
timestamp immediately to the right of MTP~1~ (if you remove a timestamp
to the left of it) which can be either g or T~1~:

If MTP~2~ = MTP~1~, then MTP~2~ < timeout because MTP~1~ < timeout.

If MTP~2~ = g, then MTP~2~ ≤ T~1~ < timeout.

If MTP~2~ = T~1~ then MTP~2~ < timeout because T~1~ < timeout.

So, the MTP of B~2~ is less than timeout in all cases, and all blocks
(>95%) of the last 2,016 blocks signal support, which means the
deployment will move to `LOCKED_IN` and—2,016 blocks later—to `ACTIVE`.
--

. A portion (<30%) of the economy starts rejecting blocks that
don’t comply with your soft fork. This means you’ll cause a blockchain
split that will remain as long as a majority of miners support the Old
branch.

. When most of the economy starts rejecting Old blocks, miners
probably won’t want to mine Old blocks because the block rewards will
become nearly worthless for them. It would be hard for miners to sell
their Old coins on an exchange or pay for electricity with them. If they
switch to mine New blocks instead, plenty of options exist for
exchanging their block rewards for goods, services, or other currencies.

. The nonmining users using Old software will automatically switch
to the New branch once that branch is stronger than the Old branch. This
is because, in a soft fork, the New branch is valid according to the Old
software.
