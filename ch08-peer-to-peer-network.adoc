== Peer-to-peer network
:baseimagedir: images
:imagedir: {baseimagedir}/ch08
This chapter covers

* Removing the last central authority: the shared folder

* Following a transaction in the peer-to-peer network

* Leaving behind the silly cookie tokens

* Bootstrapping the peer-to-peer network

Let’s talk about the elephant in the room: the shared folder. All blocks
the miners produce must pass through the shared folder on their way to
other full nodes and miners. This chapter will remove the central shared
folder and replace it with a decentralized _peer-to-peer network_
(<<fig0801>>). The peer-to-peer network lets full nodes (including
miners) send blocks directly to each other. When nodes can talk directly
to each other, we no longer need a central point of authority for
communication.

Another issue we haven’t talked much about is how wallets send
transactions via email to the miners. When a new miner joins the system,
all wallets need to update their miner list. Not cool. With this nice
peer-to-peer network of nodes, wallets can broadcast their transactions
to all miners without knowing who or where they are.

[[fig0801]]
.Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer network
image::{imagedir}/08-01.svg[{big-width}]

We’ll follow a transaction’s path through the network, both as an
unconfirmed transaction and, eventually, as part of a mined block. The
transaction will start in John’s wallet and end as a confirmed
transaction in the blockchain with the cafe’s wallet being notified
about it.

After following the transaction through the system, you’ll no longer
need the cookie token system to help you understand Bitcoin. We’ll talk
only about Bitcoin from that point forward. Practically no differences
exist between the cookie token system and Bitcoin anymore, so it doesn’t
make sense to keep talking about cookie tokens when, in fact, you want
to learn about Bitcoin!

The last topic in this chapter will cover how a new node connects to and
becomes part of the peer-to-peer network. This is far from trivial. How
does it find nodes to connect to? How does it download the blockchain up
to the latest block? We’ll sort all that out. Toward the end of the
chapter, you’ll learn how to set up a full node of your own.

=== The shared folder

The shared folder administrator, Luke, is a central authority
(<<fig0802>>). He ultimately gets to decide which blocks can be stored
in the shared folder. He also gets to decide who can read from and
write to the shared folder.

[[fig0802]]
.The shared folder is a central point of authority.
image::{imagedir}/08-02.svg[{big-width}]

So far, we’ve assumed Luke is a totally neutral good guy—but what if he
isn’t, or what if he’s forced by Acme Insurances to reject certain
blocks? What’s the point of proof of work if the system can be censored
at the block level? Proof of work made the _transactions_
censorship-resistant because it let users send their transactions to
multiple miners. But the _blocks_ containing the transactions can still
be censored by whoever has administrator privileges over the shared
folder. Simply put, the system isn’t yet censorship-resistant. As long
as a single entity can decide which blocks or transactions to allow, the
system isn’t censorship-resistant.

The shared folder poses yet another problem. Imagine that Rashid has
created a 1 MB block and published it to the shared folder. Everyone
watching the shared folder, all full nodes, will download Rashid’s block
at the same time. If you have 100 full nodes, the total amount of data
you need to send from the shared folder to the different nodes is 
100 MB. This will cause _block propagation_—the transfer of a block
from its creator to all other nodes—to be terribly slow. The more nodes,
the slower the block propagation.

=== Let’s build a peer-to-peer network

What if the full nodes and miners could talk directly to each other
instead of relying on the central shared folder? They could send the
blocks directly to one another in a peer-to-peer network (<<fig0803>>).

[[fig0803]]
.In a peer-to-peer network, blocks are passed from one node to another, much as gossip spreads among people.
image::{imagedir}/08-03.svg[{big-width}]

Think of the peer-to-peer network as a large number of people. One
person doesn’t know everyone else, but might know three people. When
something interesting happens—for example, Rashid finds a block—he tells
his three friends about it, who in turn tell all their friends, and so
on until everybody knows about this new block. We call such networks
_gossip networks_ for apparent reasons.

[.gbinfo]
.Relay
****
To _relay_ a received block means to pass the block on to others.
****

[role="important"]

Blocks can no longer be easily stopped. A node can choose not to pass a
block on, or _relay_ it, to its peers, but the peers are connected to
several other peers that will gladly relay the block to them. A single
node can’t do much to censor information.

Suppose Rashid finds a block, and he wants to get this block out to
all nodes. Rashid sends his block to Qi, Tom, and the cafe. For some
reason, the cafe doesn’t forward the block to Lisa (<<fig0804>>). But
Lisa has several peers in this network. She’s connected to Tom
and Qi. Tom will tell Lisa about this new block and send it
to her. The cafe can’t hide information from Lisa as long as she’s
well-connected—that is, has many different peers.

[[fig0804]]
.If the cafe refuses to relay a block to Lisa, someone else will do it.
image::{imagedir}/08-04.svg[{big-width}]

Now that you have this nice network, wallets can use it to get their
transactions sent to miners. Then they won’t have to keep track of
miner email addresses anymore. The transactions will be broadcast over
the peer-to-peer network and reach all full nodes within seconds. This
includes the miners, because they’re also full nodes. We covered this
briefly in <<ch01>>, as repeated in <<fig0805>>.

[[fig0805]]
.Transactions travel the peer-to-peer network just like blocks do. Wallets no longer need to know the miners.
image::{imagedir}/08-05.svg[{big-width}]

The same thing goes here as for blocks: a single node can’t hinder
transactions from spreading across the network. Another pleasant
effect of using the peer-to-peer network for transactions is that a
transaction’s recipient can be notified that the transaction is
_pending_, or is about to be confirmed. We’ll look at how this works
a bit later.

=== How do peers talk?

[.gbinfo]
.TCP
****
When you open a web page on https://bitcoin.org, your web browser will
make a TCP connection to bitcoin.org, download a web page through that
connection, and display it to you.
****

Let’s look at how the communication between two peers happens. We’ll
look specifically at how Tom connects to Lisa and how they communicate
across their communication channel, called a Transmission Control
Protocol (TCP) connection (<<fig0806>>).

[[fig0806]]
.Tom and Lisa communicate over the internet through a communication channel.
image::{imagedir}/08-06.svg[{half-width}]

Suppose Tom’s node knows about Lisa’s node. I’ll explain in
<<bootstrapping-the-network>> how Tom learns about other nodes. For now,
let’s assume he has the _IP address_ and _port_ of Lisa’s node. He now
wants to connect to Lisa’s node to communicate with it. All computers on
the internet have an Internet Protocol (IP) address, which is how one
computer can send information to another. A computer program that
listens for incoming connections must listen on a specific port number
of its computer’s IP address. Lisa’s computer has the IP address
142.12.233.96 and runs a cookie token program that listens for incoming
connections on port 8333.

[.inbitcoin]
.Port 8333
****
Port 8333 is the default listening port in Bitcoin Core, the most
widely used full node software.
****

Tom’s node connects to Lisa’s node through the IP address
142.12.233.96 and TCP port 8333. His node (computer program) starts by
asking its operating system (OS) to initiate a connection to Lisa
(<<fig0807>>). The OS sends a message to Lisa’s computer saying that
Tom wants to talk to a computer program on Lisa’s port 8333. Her
computer knows a program is listening on port 8333, so it sends back a
“Sure, welcome” message.  Tom’s computer acknowledges this by sending
back an “OK, cool. Let’s talk …” message.

[[fig0807]]
.Tom’s computer program sets up a TCP connection to Lisa’s computer program. After this, they can send and receive data between each other.
image::{imagedir}/08-07.svg[{half-width}]

The node software on Tom’s and Lisa’s computers wasn’t involved in this
exchange—it was carried out by their OSs, such as Linux, Windows, or
macOS. When the message sequence is finished, the OS hands the
connection over to the node software. Lisa’s and Tom’s nodes can now
speak freely to each other. Tom can send data to Lisa, and Lisa can send
data to Tom over this communication channel, or _TCP connection_.

[[the-network-protocol]]
=== The network protocol

Tom and Lisa can now send and receive data over a communi­cation
channel. But if Tom’s node speaks a language that Lisa’s node doesn’t
understand, the communication won’t be meaningful (<<fig0808>>). The
nodes must have a common language: a _protocol_.

[[fig0808]]
.Lisa must be able to understand what Tom writes on the channel.
image::{imagedir}/08-08.svg[{half-width}]

The cookie token network protocol defines a set of message types that
are allowed. A typical message in the cookie token (well, Bitcoin)
network is the `inv` message (<<fig0809>>).

[.gbinfo]
.This is an abstraction
****
Real network messages don’t look exactly like these; I provide an
abstract view of the messages. The exact format of the network
messages is out of the scope of this book.
****

[[fig0809]]
.A typical network message
image::{imagedir}/08-09.svg[{big-width}]

A node uses the `inv`—short for _inventory_—message to inform other
nodes about something it has. In <<fig0809>>, Tom’s node informs
Lisa’s node that Tom has three things to offer Lisa: two transactions
and a block. The message contains an ID for each of these items.

==== John sends the transaction

Let’s follow a transaction through the network from start to end to see
what network messages are being used. We’ll assume the peer-to-peer
network is already set up. We’ll come back to how the network is
_bootstrapped_ later in this chapter.

In <<lightweight-wallets>>, we said that wallets can connect to full
nodes and get information about all block headers and transactions
concerning them using bloom filters and merkle proofs (<<fig0810>>).

[[fig0810]]
.Lightweight wallets communicate with nodes using the Bitcoin network protocol.
image::{imagedir}/08-10.svg[{big-width}]

I didn’t go into detail then about how this communication works. It uses
the same protocol the nodes use when they communicate with each other.
The wallets and the full nodes (including miners) all speak the same
“language.”

Suppose John wants to buy a cookie from the cafe. John’s wallet is
connected to Tom’s node with a TCP connection. He scans the payment URI
from the cafe’s wallet. John’s wallet creates and signs a transaction.
You know the drill. Then it’s time to send the transaction to Tom’s node
(<<fig0811>>).

[[fig0811]]
.The transaction is sent to Tom’s node through a TCP connection.
image::{imagedir}/08-11.svg[{half-width}]

This happens in a three-step process. John’s wallet doesn’t just send
the transaction unsolicited: it first informs Tom’s node that there’s a
transaction to be fetched (<<fig0812>>).

[[fig0812]]
.Tom’s node is informed about John’s transaction so that Tom can fetch it.
image::{imagedir}/08-12.svg[{big-width}]

The first message is an `inv` message, as described in the previous
section. John’s wallet sends the `inv` to Tom’s full node. Tom checks if
he already has the transaction. He doesn’t, because John’s wallet just
created it and hasn’t sent it to anyone yet. Tom’s node wants to get
this transaction, so he requests it with a `getdata` message that looks
just like an `inv` message but with a different meaning: `getdata`
means “I want this stuff,” whereas `inv` means “I have this stuff.”

John’s wallet receives the `getdata` message and sends a `tx` message
containing the entire transaction to Tom’s node. Tom will verify the
transaction and keep it. He’ll also relay this transaction to his
network neighbors.

You might ask, “Why doesn’t John’s wallet send the entire transaction
immediately? Why go through the hassle with `inv` and `getdata`?” This
will become clear later, but it’s because nodes might already have the
transaction; we save bandwidth by sending only transaction hashes
instead of entire transactions.

==== Tom forwards the transaction

If the transaction is valid, Tom’s node will inform his neighbors about
it (<<fig0813>>) using an `inv` message, just like John’s wallet did
when it informed Tom’s node about the transaction.

[[fig0813]]
.Tom forwards the transaction to his peers.
image::{imagedir}/08-13.svg[{big-width}]

The process is the same for these three message exchanges as the one
John used when he first sent the transaction to Tom (<<fig0814>>). Lisa,
Qi, and Rashid will get an `inv` message from Tom.

[[fig0814]]
.Tom’s node sends the transaction to Qi’s node using the familiar three-step process.
image::{imagedir}/08-14.svg[{big-width}]

[.bigside]
****
image::{imagedir}/u08-01.svg[]
****

When Lisa, Qi, and Rashid have received the transaction, they too will
inform their peers about it after they’ve verified it. Qi’s and Rashid’s
nodes are a bit slower, so it takes them a while to verify the
transaction; we’ll get back to them later.

Lisa was quick to verify the transaction, so she’ll be the first of the
three to relay it. She already knows that she received the transaction
from Tom, so she won’t inform Tom’s node with an `inv` message. But Lisa
doesn’t know that Qi already has the transaction, and she doesn’t know
if the cafe has it. She’ll send an `inv` to those two nodes. The cafe’s
node will send back a `getdata` because it hasn’t yet seen this
transaction. Qi’s node already has this transaction and won’t reply with
anything (<<fig0815>>). She’ll remember that Lisa has it, though.

[[fig0815]]
.Lisa’s node sends an `inv` to Qi’s node, but Qi’s node already has the transaction.
image::{imagedir}/08-15.svg[{big-width}]

[.bigside]
****
image::{imagedir}/u08-02.svg[]
****

Qi has just finished verifying the transaction. She knows that Lisa’s
node has it, so she doesn’t have to send an `inv` to Lisa’s node. But
she doesn’t know if Rashid has it, so she sends an `inv` to Rashid’s
node.

Rashid’s was the slowest node when verifying John’s transaction, so when
it’s time for him to send an `inv` to his neighbors, he’s already
received an `inv` from Qi’s node. And he also knows from earlier that
Tom already has the transaction. He’ll just send an `inv` to the cafe’s
node, which will ignore the `inv` because it already has the
transaction.

==== The cafe’s lightweight wallet is notified

I said earlier that a good thing about letting transactions travel the
peer-to-peer network is that the recipient wallet can get a quick
notification of the pending transaction. Let’s explore this now.

The cafe’s full node has received the transaction and verified it. The
cafe also has a lightweight wallet on a mobile phone that it uses to
send and receive money. The cafe is concerned with security, so it
configured this lightweight wallet to connect only the cafe’s own full
node, its _trusted node_ (<<fig0816>>).

[[fig0816]]
.The cafe’s lightweight wallet has a TCP connection to its own full node.
image::{imagedir}/08-16.svg[{half-width}]

This common setup gives the cafe the complete security of a full node
combined with the flexibility and mobility of a lightweight wallet. I
described this setup in <<security-of-lightweight-wallets>>.

The cafe’s full node has just verified John’s transaction. It now wants
to inform its neighbors about this new transaction. It’s connected to
Lisa’s node, Rashid’s node, and the cafe’s lightweight wallet. The full
node already knows that Lisa’s and Rashid’s nodes have this transaction,
so it doesn’t send an `inv` to those two nodes. The full node doesn’t
know whether the wallet has the transaction, but it won’t immediately
send an `inv` message to the wallet.

[.biside]
.Bloom filter
****
image::{imagedir}/u08-03.svg[]
****

The wallet is a lightweight wallet, which uses bloom filters,
described in <<bloom-filters-obfuscate-addresses>>. The full node will
test the transaction against the bloom filter and, if it matches, send
an `inv` message to the wallet. If there’s no match, it won’t send an
`inv` message.

John’s transaction is for the cafe, so the bloom filter will match the
transaction, and the full node will send an `inv`. The wallet will
request the actual transaction using `getdata`, as <<fig0817>> shows.

[[fig0817]]
.The cafe’s wallet gets John’s transaction from the cafe’s trusted node after the transaction is checked against the bloom filter.
image::{imagedir}/08-17.svg[{half-width}]

The wallet has now received the transaction. It can show a message to
the cafe owner that a transaction is pending. The cafe owner has a
choice: trust that the transaction—a so-called _0-conf
transaction_—will be confirmed eventually, or wait until the
transaction is confirmed. If the cafe accepts the 0-conf transaction,
then it trusts that John has paid a high enough transaction fee and that
the transaction won’t be double spent.

This time, the cafe decides that it needs to wait until the transaction
is included in a valid block. This brings us to the next phase:
including the transaction in a block in the blockchain.

[[include-the-transaction-in-a-block]]
==== Including the transaction in a block

[.bigside]
****
image::{imagedir}/u08-04.svg[]
****

Let’s recall some of the miners in this system. At the end of
<<mitigating-miner-centralization>>, there were 10 different
miners; but let’s go back in time and pretend Qi, Tom, Lisa, and Rashid
are the only miners in this system right now.

The transaction reached all these miners during transaction propagation.
John’s wallet used to send the transaction via email to all miners. Now,
he sends it to any of the full nodes, and it propagates across the entire
peer-to-peer network. Miners can choose to include John’s transaction in
the blocks they’re mining. Suppose the transaction includes a
transaction fee so that some or all miners are willing to include it,
and that Rashid is the next miner to find a valid proof of work for his
block, which happens to contain John’s transaction (<<fig0818>>).

[[fig0818]]
.Rashid’s block containing John’s transaction
image::{imagedir}/08-18.svg[{half-width}]

Rashid wants to get his block to the other miners as quickly as possible
to minimize the risk of some other miner getting a block out before
Rashid’s block.

[.inbitcoin]
.BIP130
****
This process is defined in BIP130, which replaces an old
block-propagation mechanism that used `inv` messages.
****

He creates a `headers` message and sends it to all his peers: Tom, the
cafe, and Qi. Rashid’s peers will send back a `getdata` message, and
Rashid will reply with the actual block. The message exchange between
Rashid and Qi will look like the one in <<fig0819>>.

[[fig0819]]
.Rashid’s node sends Rashid’s block to Qi’s node.
image::{imagedir}/08-19.svg[{half-width}]

[.bigside]
****
image::{imagedir}/u08-05.svg[]
****

The actual block is sent in a `block` message containing the full block.

Let’s continue the block propagation throughout the peer-to-peer
network. Rashid has sent his block to Tom, the cafe, and Qi. Now, these
three nodes will verify the block and, if it’s valid, send out `headers`
messages to all their peers who might not already have it (<<fig0820>>).

Qi and Tom happen to send their `headers` messages to each other at the
same time. This isn’t a problem; because they both have the block,
they’ll ignore the `headers` received from peers. Lisa will request the
block from one of her peers just like Qi requested the block from
Rashid.

[[fig0820]]
.All but Lisa have the block. Tom, the cafe, and Qi send `headers` messages.
image::{imagedir}/08-20.svg[{big-width}]

This concludes the propagation of this block—almost. The lightweight
wallets need to be informed about the block.

==== Notifying wallets

Tom’s node is connected to John’s wallet, so Tom sends a `headers`
message to John. Likewise, the cafe’s full node sends a `headers`
message to the cafe’s lightweight wallet. Tom’s and the cafe’s full
nodes won’t test the block against the bloom filters in any way. They
will send the `headers` message unconditionally, but the lightweight
wallets won’t request the full blocks.

As you might recall from <<ch06>>, lightweight wallets don’t download
the full blocks. Most of the time, John’s wallet is only interested in
the block headers so it can verify the blockchain’s proof of work. But
every now and then, transactions that are relevant to John’s wallet
are in the blocks, and the wallet wants proof that those transactions
are included in the block. To find out if there are any relevant
transactions, he sends a `getdata` message to Tom, requesting a
`merkleblock` message for the block.

John gets a `merkleblock` message containing the block header and a
partial merkle tree connecting his transaction ID (txid) to the merkle
root in the block header (<<fig0821>>).

[[fig0821]]
.Tom sends a `merkleblock` containing a merkle proof that John’s transaction is in the block.
image::{imagedir}/08-21.svg[{big-width}]

<<fig0822>> gives a little repetition from <<ch06>>.

[[fig0822]]
.The `merkleblock` message contains a block header and a partial merkle tree.
image::{imagedir}/08-22.svg[{big-width}]

John’s wallet will verify that

* The block header is correct and has a valid proof of work.

* The merkle root in the header can be reconstructed using the partial
merkle tree.

* The txid of John’s transaction is included in the partial merkle tree.
He doesn’t care about the irrelevant transaction that’s used to
obfuscate what belongs to John.

[.bigside]
****
image::{imagedir}/u08-06.svg[]
****

John’s wallet is now sure his transaction is contained in the new block.
The wallet can display a message to John saying, “Your transaction has 1
confirmation.”

The cafe’s lightweight wallet will be notified the same way.

Because the cafe’s wallet uses a trusted node, privacy isn’t much of an
issue (<<fig0823>>). The wallet can use a big bloom filter to reduce the
number of irrelevant transactions, which in turn will reduce mobile data
traffic. The sparser the bloom filter, the less extra obfuscation +
traffic will be sent to the wallet.

[[fig0823]]
.The cafe requests a merkle block from its trusted full node.
image::{imagedir}/08-23.svg[{big-width}]

The cafe’s owner feels comfortable handing the cookie over to
John now.  John eats his cookie. The deal is done.

==== More confirmations

As time passes, more blocks will be mined by the miners. These blocks
will all propagate the network and end up on every full node. The
lightweight wallets will get merkle blocks to save bandwidth.

For each new block coming in, John’s transaction will be buried under
more and more proof of work (<<fig0824>>). This makes John’s transaction
harder and harder to double spend. For each new block, the transaction
will get one more confirmation.

[[fig0824]]
.As more blocks arrive, John’s transaction becomes safer and safer.
image::{imagedir}/08-24.svg[{big-width}]

=== Leaving the cookie token system

I don’t think the cookie token system will add any more to your
understanding of Bitcoin. It’s time to let go of the cookie tokens and
start talking solely about Bitcoin. We’ve developed the cookie token
system to a point where there are no differences from
Bitcoin. <<tab0801>> shows the concept mapping table.

[[tab0801]]

The last cookie token concept that differs from Bitcoin, the shared
folder, has been eliminated. Let’s look at how it all happened, in
<<fig0825>>.

We’ll keep our friends at the office a while longer. John will probably
have to buy a few more cookies, but he’ll use Bitcoin to do it.

==== Bitcoin at a glance

The Bitcoin peer-to-peer network is huge. As of this writing:

[.movingtarget]
* There are about 10,000 publicly accessible full nodes.

* Bitcoin’s money supply is about 17,400,000 BTC.

* Each bitcoin is worth around $6,500.

* Bitcoin processes about 250,000 transactions per day.

* An estimate of 100,000 BTC, valued at $630 million, is moved daily.

* The total mining hashrate is about 50 Ehash/s, or 50 × 10^18^ hash/s. +
A typical desktop computer can do about 25 Mhash/s.

* The transaction fees paid each day total around 17 BTC. This averages to
6,800 satoshis per transaction, or about $0.40 per transaction.

* People in all corners of the world use Bitcoin to get around problems in
their day-to-day lives.

[.periscope]
=== Where were we?

This chapter is about Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer network. The first half of
the chapter described the network in action after it’s been set up, as
illustrated by <<fig0826>>, repeated from <<ch01>>.

[[fig0826]]
.The Bitcoin network distributes blocks (and transactions) to all participants.
image::{imagedir}/08-26.svg[{half-width}]

The second half of this chapter will look at how a new node joins the
network.

[[bootstrapping-the-network]]
=== Bootstrapping the network

The scenario in <<the-network-protocol>> assumed that all nodes involved
were already connected to each other. But how does a new node start? How
would it find other nodes to connect to? How would it download the full
blockchain from the genesis block, block 0, up to the latest block? How
does it know what the latest block is?

Let’s sort it out.

Suppose Selma wants to start her own full node. This is how it would
typically happen (<<fig0827>>):

1. Selma downloads, verifies, and starts the full node computer program.

2. The computer program connects to some nodes.

3. Selma’s node downloads blocks from her peers.

4. Selma’s node enters a normal mode of operation.

[[fig0827]]
.Running a full node involves downloading and running the software, connecting to other nodes, downloading old blocks, and entering normal operation.
image::{imagedir}/08-27.svg[{full-width}]

[[step-1]]
==== Step 1—Run the software

[.bigside]
****
image::{imagedir}/u08-08.svg[]
****

Selma needs a computer program to run a full node. The most commonly
used such program is Bitcoin Core. Several others are available, such as
libbitcoin, bcoin, bitcoinj, and btcd. We’ll focus only on Bitcoin Core,
but you’re encouraged to explore the others yourself.

To download Bitcoin Core, Selma visits its web page,
https://bitcoincore.org, and finds a download link there. But she
encounters a potential problem: Selma isn’t sure the program she
downloads is actually the version the developers behind Bitcoin Core
released. Someone could have fooled Selma into downloading the program
from bitconcore.org instead of bitcoincore.org, or someone might have
hacked bitcoincore.org and replaced the downloadable files with
alternative programs.

The Bitcoin Core team therefore signs all released versions of the
program with a private key—let’s call it the _Bitcoin Core
key_. They provide the signature in a downloadable file, named
SHA256SUMS.asc. This file contains the hash value of the released
Bitcoin Core software and a signature that signs the contents of the
SHA256SUMS.asc file (<<fig0828>>).

[[fig0828]]
.The Bitcoin Core team signs the released program with their private key.
image::{imagedir}/08-28.svg[{big-width}]

Selma has downloaded both the program, in a file called
bitcoin-0.17.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz, and the signature file,
SHA256SUMS.asc. To verify that the program is in fact signed by the
Bitcoin Core private key, she needs to know the corresponding public
key. But how can she know what this key is?

This is a hard problem. Remember when Lisa used to sign blocks with her
private key? How would the full nodes verify that the blocks were
actually signed by Lisa? They used multiple sources to fetch Lisa’s
public key—for example, looking at the bulletin board at the entrance of
the office, checking the company’s intranet, and asking colleagues. The
same applies here; you shouldn’t trust a single source, but should use
at least two different sources. The key that’s currently being used to
sign Bitcoin Core releases is named

 Wladimir J. van der Laan (Bitcoin Core binary release signing key) <laanwj@gmail.com>

and has the following 160-bit SHA1 hash, called _fingerprint_:

 01EA 5486 DE18 A882 D4C2  6845 90C8 019E 36C2 E964

This book can serve as _one_ of Selma’s sources. She decides to

* Get the fingerprint of the key from https://bitcoincore.org.

* Verify the fingerprint with the _Grokking Bitcoin_ book.

* Verify the fingerprint with a friend.

[.gbinfo]
.Where to get the key
****
It doesn’t really matter where you get the actual public key, but it’s
important to verify that its fingerprint is what you expect.
****

The fingerprints from the three sources match, so Selma downloads the
public key from a _key server_. A key server is a computer on the
internet that provides a repository of keys. Key servers are commonly
used to download keys identified by the key’s fingerprint. Selma doesn’t
trust the key server, so she needs to verify that the fingerprint of the
downloaded key matches the expected fingerprint, which it does.

Now, when she has the Bitcoin Core public key, she can verify the
signature of the SHA256SUMS.asc file (<<fig0829>>).

She uses the Bitcoin Core public key to verify the signature in the
signature file. She must also verify that the program has the same
hash value as stated in SHA256SUMS.asc. The signature is valid, and
the hashes match, which means Selma can be sure the software she’s
about to run is authentic.

[[fig0829]]
. Selma verifies the Bitcoin Core signature and that the hash in the signature file matches the hash of the actual program.
image::{imagedir}/08-29.svg[{big-width}]

Selma starts the program on her computer.

==== Step 2—Connect to nodes

****
image::{imagedir}/u08-09.svg[]
****

When Selma’s full node program starts, it isn’t connected to any other
nodes. She’s not part of the Bitcoin network yet. In this step, the node
will try to find peers to connect to.

To connect to a peer, the full node needs the IP address and the TCP
port for that peer. For example:

 IP: 142.12.233.96 port: 8333

An IP address and port are often written as

 142.12.233.96:8333

===== Finding initial peers

Where does Selma’s node find initial addresses of other peers? Several
sources are available (<<fig0830>>):

* Configure the full node with custom peer addresses. Selma can get an
address by asking a friend who’s running a full node.

* Use the Domain Name System (DNS) to look up initial peer addresses to
connect to.

* Use hardcoded peer addresses in the full node program.

[[fig0830]]
.Selma’s full node has three different types of sources to find initial peers.
image::{imagedir}/08-30.svg[{big-width}]

[role="important"]

Selma’s node shouldn’t initially connect to just one node. If that
single node is malicious, she’d have no way of knowing it. If you
connect to multiple nodes initially, you can verify that they all send
data consistent with each other. If not, one or more nodes are
deliberately lying to you, or they themselves have been fooled.

The default way of finding initial node addresses is to look them up in
the DNS system. DNS is a global name lookup system, used to look up IP
numbers from computer names. For example, when you visit
https://bitcoin.org with your web browser, it will use DNS to look up
the IP number of the name bitcoin.org. The Bitcoin Core software does
the same. Names to look up are hardcoded into Bitcoin Core, just like
the hardcoded IP addresses and ports. Several DNS seeds are coded into
the software. A lookup of a DNS seed can return several IP addresses,
and every new lookup might return a different set of IP addresses. The
final, third option is used as a last resort.

Note from <<fig0830>> that DNS lookups don’t return port numbers. The
other two methods of finding initial peers usually include one, but
the DNS response can return only IP addresses. The nodes on these IP
addresses are assumed to listen on the default port that Bitcoin Core
listens on, which is 8333.

===== Handshaking

[.bigside]
****
image::{imagedir}/u08-10.svg[]
****

Suppose Selma’s node chooses to connect to Qi’s node, 1.234.63.203:4567,
and to Rashid’s node, 47.196.31.246:8333. Selma sets up a TCP connection
to each of the two nodes and sends an initial message to both of them on
the new TCP connections. Let’s look at how she talks to Qi’s node
(<<fig0831>>).

[[fig0831]]
.Selma exchanges a `version` message with Qi.
image::{imagedir}/08-31.svg[{big-width}]

The exchange, called a _handshake_, starts with Selma, who sends a
`version` message to Qi. The handshake is used to agree on which
protocol version to use and tell each other what block heights they
have. The `version` message contains a lot of information not shown in
the figure, but the most essential stuff is there:

Protocol version:: The version of the network protocol, or “language,”
that peers use to talk to each other. Selma and Qi will use version
70012 because that’s the highest version Qi will understand. Selma knows
all protocol versions up to her own.

User agent:: This is shown as “software identification” in the figure
because “user agent” is a bit cryptic. It’s used to hint to the other
node what software you’re running, but it can be anything.

Height:: This is the height of the tip of the best chain the node has.

Other useful information in the `version` message includes

Services:: A list of features this node supports, such as bloom
filtering used by lightweight clients.

My address:: The IP address and port of the node sending the `version`
message. Without it, Qi wouldn’t know what address to connect to if she
restarts and wants to reconnect to Selma’s node.

When Qi’s node receives Selma’s `version` message, Qi will reply with
her own `version` message. She’ll also send a `verack` message
immediately after the `version` message. The `verack` doesn’t contain
any information; rather, it’s used to acknowledge to Selma that Qi has
received the `version` message.

As soon as Selma’s node receives Qi’s `version` message, it will reply
with a `verack` message back to Qi’s node. The handshake is done. Selma
also goes through the same procedure with Rashid’s node.

===== Finding peers’ peers

When Selma’s node is connected to Rashid’s node, it will ask that node
for other peer addresses to connect to. This way, Selma will be able to
expand her set of peers (<<fig0832>>).

[[fig0832]]
.Selma asks her peers for more peer addresses to connect to.
image::{imagedir}/08-32.svg[{big-width}]

Selma is only connected to two peers: Qi’s node and Rashid’s node. But
she thinks she needs more nodes to connect to. Being connected to only
two nodes has some implications:

* Qi and Rashid can collude to hide transactions and blocks from Selma.

* Qi’s node may break, leaving Selma with only Rashid’s node. Rashid can
then singlehandedly hide information from Selma.

* Both Qi’s and Rashid’s nodes may break, in which case Selma will be
completely disconnected from the network until she connects to some
other nodes via the initial peer-lookup mechanisms.

<<fig0833>> shows how Selma asks Rashid for more peer addresses to
connect to.

[[fig0833]]
.Selma requests more peer addresses from Rashid’s node. He responds with a bunch.
image::{imagedir}/08-33.svg[{big-width}]

[.gbinfo]
.Initial nodes
****
After getting an `addr` message, nodes disconnect from initial nodes
(except manually configured ones) to avoid overloading them. They’re
initial nodes for many other nodes.
****

Selma sends a `getaddr` message to a peer, Rashid’s node. Rashid
responds with a set of IP addresses and TCP ports that Selma can use to
connect to more peers. Rashid chooses which addresses to send to Selma,
but it’s usually the addresses to which Rashid is already connected and
possibly some that Rashid collected from his peers but didn’t use
himself.

Selma will connect to any number of the received addresses to increase
her _connectivity_. The more peers you’re connected to, the better
your connectivity. A high degree of connectivity decreases the risk of
missing out on information due to misbehaving peers. Also, information
propagates more quickly if nodes have higher connectivity. A typical
full node in Bitcoin has about 100 active connections at the same
time.  Only eight (by default) of those are _outbound connections_,
meaning connections initiated by that node. The rest are _inbound
connections_ initiated by other nodes. Consequently, a full node that
isn’t reachable on port 8333 from the internet—for example, due to a
firewall—won’t get more than eight connections in total.

==== Step 3—Synchronize

****
image::{imagedir}/u08-11.svg[]
****

Now that Selma is well-connected to, and part of, the Bitcoin network,
it’s time for her to download and verify the full blockchain up to the
latest block available. This process is called _synchronization_,
_sync_, or _initial blockchain download_.

Selma has only a single block: the genesis block. The genesis block is
hardcoded in the Bitcoin Core software, so all nodes have this block
when they start.

She needs to download all historic blocks from her peers and verify
them before she can verify newly created blocks. This is because she
has no idea what the current unspent transaction output (UTXO) set
looks like.  To build the current UTXO set, she needs to start with an
empty UTXO set, go through all historic blocks from block 0, and
update the UTXO set with the information in the transactions in the
blocks.

The process is as follows:

1. Download all historic block headers from one peer, and verify the
proof of work.

2. Download all blocks on the strongest chain from multiple peers in
parallel.

Selma selects one of her peers, Tom, to download all block headers
from.  <<fig0834>> shows how Selma’s node downloads the block headers
from Tom’s node.

[.gbinfo]
.Simplified
****
The `getheaders` message contains a list of some block IDs from Selma’s
blockchain so that Tom can find a common block they both have in case
Tom doesn’t have Selma’s tip. Let’s not bother with that.
****

She sends a `getheaders` message containing Selma’s latest block ID,
which happens to be the genesis block, block 0. Tom sends back a list of
2,000 block headers; each block header is 80 bytes. Selma verifies each
header’s proof of work and requests a new batch of headers from Tom.
This process continues until Selma receives a batch of fewer than 2,000
headers from Tom, which is a signal that he has no more headers to give
her.

[[fig0834]]
.Selma downloads block headers from Tom by repeatedly sending a `getheaders` message with her latest block ID.
image::{imagedir}/08-34.svg[{big-width}]


// TODO: Mention below that Selma doesn't wait for all headers, but for headers with
// enough total PoW before starting download.

When Selma has received all the headers from Tom, she determines which
branch is the strongest and starts downloading actual block data
belonging to that branch from her peers. She can download block data
from multiple peers at the same time to speed things up. <<fig0835>>
shows her communication with Rashid’s node.

[.inbitcoin]
.Bigger batches
****
In this example, Selma requests 3 blocks at a time, but in reality,
Bitcoin Core would request a list of at most 16 blocks per batch.
****

It starts with Selma, who sends a `getdata` message to Rashid. This
message specifies which blocks she wants to download from Rashid, who
sends back the requested blocks in `block` messages, one by one. Note
that Selma downloads only some of the blocks from Rashid. She also
downloads blocks from Tom in parallel, which is why there are gaps in
the sequence of requested blocks. The process repeats until Selma
doesn’t want any more blocks from Rashid.

[[fig0835]]
.Selma downloads blocks from Rashid by repeatedly sending a `getdata` message with a list block IDs she wants the blocks for.
image::{imagedir}/08-35.svg[{big-width}]

[.gbinfo]
.Initial download
****
[.movingtarget]

The initial blockchain download, about 210 GB as of this writing, takes
several hours, even days, depending on your hardware performance and
internet speed.
****

As Selma downloads blocks, Rashid will probably receive more fresh
blocks from his peers. Suppose he has received a new block by the time
Selma has received the first 100 blocks from Rashid. Rashid will then
send out a `headers` message to his peers, including Selma, as
described in <<include-the-transaction-in-a-block>>. This way, Selma
will be aware of all new blocks appearing during her initial
synchronization and can later request them from any peer.

As Selma receives blocks, she verifies them, updates her UTXO set, and
adds them to her own blockchain. 

[[validating-early-blocks]]
===== Verifying early blocks

The most time-consuming part of verifying a block is verifying the
transaction signatures. If you know of any block ID that’s part of a
valid blockchain, you can skip verifying the signatures of all blocks
prior to and including this block (<<fig0836>>). This will greatly speed
up the initial blockchain download up to that block.

[[fig0836]]
.To speed up initial block download, signatures of reasonably old transactions won’t be verified.
image::{imagedir}/08-36.svg[{big-width}]

Of course, other stuff, like verifying that no double spends occur or
that the block rewards are correct, is still done. The syncing node must
build its own UTXO set, so it must still go through all transactions to
be able to update the UTXO set accordingly.

Bitcoin Core ships with a preconfigured block ID of a block from some
weeks back from the release date. For Bitcoin Core 0.17.0, that block is

 height: 534292
 hash: 0000000000000000002e63058c023a9a1de233554f28c7b21380b6c9003f36a8

This is about 10,000 blocks back in the blockchain at release date. This
is, of course, a configuration parameter, and the aforementioned block
is just a default reasonable value. Selma could have changed this when
starting her node, or she could have verified with friends and other
sources she trusts that this block is in fact representing an “all valid
transactions blockchain.” She could also have disabled the feature to
verify all transaction signatures since block 0.

After a while, Selma is finally on the same page as the other nodes and
ready to enter the normal mode of operation.

==== Step 4—Normal operation

This step is easy because we already discussed it in
<<the-network-protocol>>. Selma enters the normal mode of
operation. From now on, she’ll participate in block propagation and
transaction propagation, and verify every transaction and block coming
in (<<fig0837>>).

Selma is now running a full-blown full node.

[[fig0837]]
.Selma is finally an active part of the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network.

=== Running your own full node

.Online instructions
****
More detailed instructions for all major OSs are available at
<<web-install>>.
****

[WARNING]

This section will walk you through setting up your own Bitcoin Core full
node on a Linux OS. It’s intended for readers comfortable with the Linux
OS and command line.

You’ve seen how a Bitcoin full node is downloaded, started, and
synchronized in theory. This section will help you install your own full
node.

This section requires that you

[.movingtarget]
* Have a computer with at least 2 GB of RAM running a Linux OS.

* Have lots of available disk space. As of this writing, about 210 GB is
needed.

* Have an internet connection without a limited data plan.

* Know how to start and use a command-line terminal.

If you don’t have a Linux OS, you can still use these instructions;
but you’ll have to install the version of Bitcoin Core that’s
appropriate for your system, and the commands will look different. I
suggest that you visit <<web-install>> to get up-to-date instructions
for your non-Linux OS.

The general process for getting your own node running is as follows:

1. Download Bitcoin Core from https://bitcoincore.org/en/download.

2. Verify the software.

3. Unpack and start.

4. Wait for the initial blockchain download to finish.

==== Downloading Bitcoin Core

****
image::{imagedir}/u08-12.svg[]
****

To run your own full Bitcoin node, you need the software program
to run.  In this example, you’ll download Bitcoin Core from
<<web-download>>. As of this writing, the latest version of Bitcoin
Core is 0.17.0. Let’s download it:

----
$ wget https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-0.17.0/\
    bitcoin-0.17.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
----

As the filename bitcoin-0.17.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz indicates, the
command downloads version 0.17.0 for 64-bit (x86_64) Linux
(linux-gnu).  By the time you read this, new versions of Bitcoin Core
will probably have been released. Consult <<web-download>> to get
the latest version of Bitcoin Core. Also, if you use another OS or
computer architecture, please select the file that’s right for you.

==== Verifying the software

[WARNING]

This section is hard and requires a fair amount of work on the command
line. If you just want to install and run the Bitcoin Core software
for experimental purposes, you can skip this section and jump to
<<unpack-and-start>>. If you aren’t using it for experimental
purposes, please understand the risks explained earlier in this
chapter in <<step-1>> before skipping this step.

This section will show you how to verify that the downloaded .tar.gz
file hasn’t been tampered with in any way. This file is digitally signed
by the Bitcoin Core team’s private key. The verification process
involves the following steps:

1. Download the signature file.

2. Verify that the hash of the .tar.gz file matches the hash in the
message part of the signature file.

3. Download the Bitcoin Core team’s public key.

4. Install the public key as trusted on your computer.

5. Verify the signature.

Let’s get started.

===== Downloading the signature file

To verify that your downloaded Bitcoin Core package is actually from
the Bitcoin Core team, you need to download the signature file named
SHA256SUMS.asc. <<fig0838>>, repeated from <<step-1>>, explains how
the SHA256SUMS.asc file is designed.

[[fig0838]]
.The Bitcoin Core team signs the released program with their private key.
image::{imagedir}/08-38.svg[{big-width}]

Download the signature file SHA256SUMS.asc from the same server you
downloaded the program from:

----
$ wget https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-0.17.0/SHA256SUMS.asc
----

This file will be used to verify that the downloaded .tar.gz file is
signed by the Bitcoin Core team. Note that this file is for version
0.17.0 only. If you use another version of Bitcoin Core, please select
the correct signature file at <<web-download>>.

The following listing shows what the contents of this file look like
(the actual hashes have been shortened):

The signed message in the upper part of the file lists several files
along with their respective SHA256 hashes. The listed files are
installation packages for all OSs and architectures for which Bitcoin
Core is released. The lower part of the file is the signature of the
message in the upper part. The signature commits to the entire message
and thus to all the hashes and files listed in the message.

===== Verifying the hash of the downloaded file

The file you downloaded is named bitcoin-0.17.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
so you expect that the SHA256 hash of that file matches `9d6b…5a4f`
exactly. Let’s check:

----
$ sha256sum bitcoin-0.17.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz 
9d6b472dc2aceedb1a974b93a3003a81b7e0265963bd2aa0acdcb17598215a4f  bitcoin-0.17.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
----

This command calculates the SHA256 hash of your downloaded file. It does
indeed match the hash in the SHA256SUMS.asc file. If they don’t match,
then something is wrong, and you should halt the installation and
investigate.

===== Getting the Bitcoin Core signing key

****
image::{imagedir}/u08-13.svg[]
****

To verify that the signature in the signature file was done using the
Bitcoin Core signing key, you need the corresponding public key. As
noted in <<step-1>>, you should convince yourself about what
fingerprint the Bitcoin Core key has and then download that key from
any source.

You could, for example,

* Get the fingerprint of the Bitcoin Core team’s key from
https://bitcoincore.org, the official website of the Bitcoin Core
team.

* Consult the book _Grokking Bitcoin_ to verify the fingerprint.

* Verify the fingerprint with a friend.

Start by finding the Bitcoin Core team’s public key fingerprint on their
website. You find the following fingerprint on the downloads page:

 01EA5486DE18A882D4C2684590C8019E36C2E964

Now, consult the book _Grokking Bitcoin_ to check if the fingerprint
in that book matches the fingerprint from
https://bitcoincore.org. Look in the <<step-1>> of <<ch08>> of that
book. It says

 01EA 5486 DE18 A882 D4C2  6845 90C8 019E 36C2 E964

This is the same fingerprint (although formatted slightly
differently).  The book and the website https://bitcoincore.org both
claim that this key belongs to the Bitcoin Core team. Let’s not settle
for that. You’ll also call a friend you trust and have her read the
fingerprint to you:

*You:* “Hello, Donna! What’s the fingerprint of the current Bitcoin Core
signing key?”

*Donna:* “Hi! I verified that key myself a few months ago, and I know
the fingerprint is `01EA 5486 DE18 A882 D4C2 6845 90C8 019E 36C2 E964`.”

*You:* “Thank you, it matches mine. Goodbye!”

*Donna:* “You’re welcome. Goodbye!”

Donna’s statement further strengthens your trust in this key. You think
you’ve collected enough evidence that this is, in fact, the correct key.

Let’s start downloading the key. To do this, you can use a tool called
gpg, which stands for GnuPG, which in turn stands for Gnu Privacy Guard.
This program conforms to a standard called OpenPGP (Pretty Good
Privacy). This standard specifies how keys can be exchanged and how to
do encryption and digital signatures in an interoperable way.

GnuPG is available on most Linux computers by default. To download a
public key with a certain fingerprint, you run the following `gpg`
command:

----
$ gpg --recv-keys 01EA5486DE18A882D4C2684590C8019E36C2E964
gpg: key 90C8019E36C2E964: public key "Wladimir J. van der Laan (Bitcoin Core binary release signing key) <laanwj@gmail.com>" imported
gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
----

Depending on the version of gpg you use, the output can vary. This
command downloads the public key from any available key server and
verifies that the downloaded public key in fact has the fingerprint that
you requested. The owner of this key is “Wladimir J. van der Laan
(Bitcoin Core binary release signing key).”

The prior command downloads the key into gpg and adds it to your list of
known keys. But the output of this command mentions “no ultimately
trusted keys found.” This means this key isn’t signed by any key that
you trust. You’ve only imported the key. In gpg, keys can sign other
keys to certify that the signed key is legit.

===== Signing the public key as trusted on your computer

You’ve verified that the key belongs to the Bitcoin Core team and
installed that key onto your system using gpg.

You’ll now sign that key with a private key that you own. You do this to
remember this key as trusted. The Bitcoin Core team will probably
release new versions of Bitcoin Core in the future. If GnuPG remembers
this public key as trusted, you won’t have to go through all these
key-verification steps again when you upgrade.

The process is as follows:

1. Create a key of your own.

2. Sign the Bitcoin Core public key with your own private key.

GnuPG lets you create a key of your own with the following command:

----
$ gpg --gen-key
gpg (GnuPG) 2.1.18; Copyright (C) 2017 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

Note: Use "gpg --full-generate-key" for a full featured key generation dialog.

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.
----

GnuPG will ask for your name and email address. Answer these
questions; they’ll be used to identify your key:

----
Real name: Kalle Rosenbaum
Email address: kalle@example.com
You selected this USER-ID:
    "Kalle Rosenbaum <kalle@example.com>"

Change (N)ame, (E)mail, or (O)kay/(Q)uit? 
----

Continue by pressing O (capital letter “oh”). You then need to select a
password with which to encrypt your private key. Choose a password, and
make sure you remember it.

Key generation might take a while, because it takes time to generate
good random numbers for your key. When it’s finished, you should see
output like this:

You now have a key of your own that you’ll use to sign keys that you
trust. Let’s sign the Bitcoin Core team key:

----
$ gpg --sign-key 01EA5486DE18A882D4C2684590C8019E36C2E964

     Wladimir J. van der Laan (Bitcoin Core binary release signing key) <laanwj@gmail.com>

This key is due to expire on 2019-02-14.
Are you sure that you want to sign this key with your
key "Kalle Rosenbaum <kalle@example.com>" (8DC7D3846BA6AB5E)

Really sign? (y/N)
----

Enter `y`. You’ll be prompted for your private key password. Enter it,
and press Enter. The Bitcoin Core key should now be regarded as trusted
by gpg. This will simplify the process when you upgrade your node in the
future.

Let’s look at your newly signed key:

----
$ gpg --list-keys 01EA5486DE18A882D4C2684590C8019E36C2E964
pub   rsa4096 2015-06-24 [SC] [expires: 2019-02-14]

uid           [  full  ] Wladimir J. van der Laan (Bitcoin Core binary release signing key) <laanwj@gmail.com>
----

The word to look for is `full` in square brackets. This means gpg, and
you, fully trust this key.

===== Verifying the signature

It’s time to verify the signature of the SHA256SUMS.asc file:

----
$ gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc 
gpg: Signature made Wed 03 Oct 2018 10:53:25 AM CEST
gpg:                using RSA key 90C8019E36C2E964
gpg: Good signature from "Wladimir J. van der Laan (Bitcoin Core binary release signing key) <laanwj@gmail.com>" [full]
----

It says that the signature is `Good` and that it’s signed with a key
that you fully trust, `[full]`.

To summarize, you’ve done the following:

1. Downloaded Bitcoin Core and the signature file

2. Verified that the hash of the .tar.gz file matches the stated hash in
SHA256SUMS.asc

3. Downloaded a public key and verified that it belongs to Bitcoin Core

4. Signed that key with your own private key so GnuPG and you remember that
the Bitcoin Core key is legit

5. Verified the signature of the SHA256SUMS.asc file

When you later upgrade the program, you can skip several of these steps.
The process will then be

1. Download Bitcoin Core and the signature file.

2. Verify that the hash of the .tar.gz file matches the stated hash in
SHA256SUMS.asc.

3. Verify the signature of the SHA256SUMS.asc file.

==== Unpacking and starting

Let’s unpack the software:

----
tar -zxvf bitcoin-0.17.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
----

This will create a directory called bitcoin-0.17.0. Go into the
directory bitcoin-0.17.0/bin, and have a look:

----
$ cd bitcoin-0.17.0/bin
$ ls
bitcoin-cli  bitcoind  bitcoin-qt  bitcoin-tx  test_bitcoin
----

Here you have several executable programs:

* bitcoin-cli is a program you can use to extract information about the
node you’re running as well as manage a built-in wallet that’s shipped
with Bitcoin Core.

* bitcoind is the program to use if you want to run the node in the
background without a graphical user interface (GUI).

* bitcoin-qt is the program to run if you want a GUI for your node. This
is mainly useful if you use the built-in wallet.

* bitcoin-tx is a small utility program to create and modify Bitcoin
transactions.

* test_bitcoin lets you test run a test suite.

In this tutorial, you’ll run bitcoind, which stands for “Bitcoin
daemon.” In UNIX systems such as Linux, the word _daemon_ is used for
computer programs that run in the background.

Let’s start the Bitcoin Core daemon in the background and see what
happens:

----
$ ./bitcoind -daemon
Bitcoin server starting
----

This starts your node. It will automatically begin connecting to peers
and downloading the blockchain for you.

==== Initial blockchain download

****
image::{imagedir}/u08-14.svg[]
****

This process will take time. Depending on your internet connection,
processor, and disk, it can vary from several days down to a few hours.

You can use the bitcoin-cli program to query the running node about
the download progress, as in the following:

----
$ ./bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo
{
  "chain": "main",
  "blocks": 207546,
  "headers": 549398,
  "bestblockhash": "00000000000003a6a5f2f360f02a3b8e4c214d27bd8e079a70f5fb630a0817c5",

    },
    {

      "version": 3,
      "reject": {
        "status": false
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "bip65",
      "version": 4,
      "reject": {
        "status": false
      }
    }
  ],
  "bip9_softforks": {
    "csv": {
      "status": "defined",
      "startTime": 1462060800,

      "since": 0
    },
    "segwit": {

      "startTime": 1479168000,

    }
  },
  "warnings": ""
}
----

This command shows a lot of information about the blockchain. Note that
blocks have been downloaded and verified up to height 207546. Bitcoin
Core will download block headers prior to the full blocks to verify
proof of work. This node has downloaded headers up to height 549398,
which are all the headers there are at this time. Another interesting
thing is the `initialblockdownload` field, which will remain `true`
until the initial block download is finished.

Keep this daemon running. You’ll get back to it in appendix A, where
I’ll give you a small tutorial on how to use bitcoin-cli to examine the
blockchain and use your built-in wallet.

If you want to stop the node, issue the following command:

----
$ ./bitcoin-cli stop
----

You can start the node again whenever you like, and the node will begin
where it left off.

=== Recap

We’ve replaced the last central point of authority, the shared folder,
with a peer-to-peer network. In a peer-to-peer network, the full nodes
communicate directly with each other. Each node is connected to several
(potentially hundreds of) other nodes. This makes it extremely hard to
prevent blocks and transactions from propagating the network.

This chapter had two main parts:

* How transactions and blocks flow through the network

* How new nodes join the network

==== Part 1—Following a transaction

In the first part of the chapter, we followed a transaction through the
system. It started with John buying a cookie. His transaction was
propagated across the peer-to-peer network and to the cafe’s wallet.

image::{imagedir}/u08-15.svg[{big-width}]

The cafe will almost immediately see that a transaction is incoming, but
it’s not yet confirmed. The next stage is to mine the block. Rashid is
the lucky miner who finds the next block containing John’s transaction.

image::{imagedir}/u08-16.svg[{big-width}]

Rashid sends out the block to his peers, who will relay it to their
peers and so on until the block has reached the entire network. Part of
this propagation includes sending the block to lightweight wallets.
These lightweight wallets will request `merkleblock` messages from the
full node so they don’t have to download the full block.

==== Part 2—Joining the network

Starting a new node involves fours steps:

image::{imagedir}/u08-17.svg[{full-width}]

1. Download and verify, for example, the Bitcoin Core software. Then
start it.

2. Connect to other nodes.

3. Download historic blocks.

4. Enter normal operation.

==== System changes

The table of concept mappings between the cookie token system and
Bitcoin has become tiny (<<tab0802>>).

[[tab0802]]
[%autowidth]
.The shared folder has been ditched in favor of a peer-to-peer network.
|===
| Cookie tokens | Bitcoin | Covered in

| 1 cookie token | 1 bitcoin | <<ch02>>
|===

Given that there are no longer any technical differences between the
cookie token system and the Bitcoin system, we’ll drop the cookie tokens
and work only with Bitcoin from now on.

This will be the final release of the cookie token system. Another, much
more widely used system, Bitcoin, has taken the world by storm, and
we’ve decided to ditch the cookie token project. Enjoy the last version
(<<tab0803>>).

=== Exercises

==== Warm up

. Why is the shared folder a bad idea?

. What does it mean to relay a transaction or a block?

. What are `inv` messages used for?

. How does the full node decide what transactions to send to
lightweight wallets?

. How does a node notify a lightweight wallet about an incoming
pending transaction?

. Blocks aren’t sent in full to lightweight wallets. What part of
the block is always sent to the wallet?

. Why does the cafe send a very big bloom filter to its trusted
node?

. What would a security-conscious person do after downloading
Bitcoin Core but before starting the software?

. What types of sources for peer addresses are available to a
newly started node?

. How would a full node know if any newly created blocks are available
for download when it’s finished syncing?

. The Bitcoin peer-to-peer network consists of the following
nodes:
+
image::{imagedir}/u08-18.svg[{half-width}]
+
Which node owners do you need to threaten to prevent Lisa from getting
any blocks but those she creates herself?

==== Dig in

[start=12]


. Suppose Qi just received two transactions with transaction IDs
TXID~1~ and TXID~2~. She now wants to inform Rashid about these new
transactions. She doesn’t know if Rashid already knows about them. What
does she do?

. Suppose you’re running a full node and experience a power
outage for 18 minutes. When power comes back, you start your node again.
During those 18 minutes, two blocks, B~1~ and B~2~, have been created.
Your latest block is B~0~. What will your node do after reconnecting to
the network? For simplicity, assume that no new blocks are found during
synchronization, and that you have only one peer. Use this table of
message types to fill out the following template:
+
[%autowidth]
|===
| Type | Data | Purpose

| `block` | Full block | Sends a block to a peer
| `getheaders` | Block ID | Asks a peer for subsequent block headers after the given block ID
| `getdata` | txids or block IDs | Requests data from a peer
| `headers` | List of headers | Sends a list of headers to a peer
|===
+

=== Summary

* The peer-to-peer network makes blocks censorship-resistant.

* A node connects to multiple peers to reduce their vulnerability for
information hiding.

* The Bitcoin network protocol is the “language” nodes speak to
communicate.

* Transactions are broadcast on the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network to
reach both miners and the recipient of the money early.

* New nodes synchronize with the Bitcoin network to get up to date
with the other nodes. This takes hours or days.

* Nodes don’t need to stay online 24/7. They can drop out and come
back and sync up the latest stuff.

* Signature verification can be skipped for older blocks to speed up
initial synchronization. This is useful if you know a specific block
is valid.
